%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% Allow "Thomas van Noord" and "Simon de Laguarde" and alike to be sorted by "N" and "L" etc. in the bibliography.
% Write the name in the bibliography as "\VAN{Noord}{Van}{van} Noord, Thomas"

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}


\section{Observations and data reduction}

Normally the next section describes the techniques the authors used.
It is frequently split into subsections, such as Section~\ref{sec:maths} below.

\subsection{NICER}
\label{sec:maths} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere

Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
or $v=220$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered
as a numbered equation:


%\begin{equation}
%    x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
%	\label{eq:quadratic}
%\end{equation}


\subsection{XMM-Newton}


% Example figure
%\begin{figure}
	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
%	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example}
%    \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each figure.
%	Give enough detail for the reader to understand what they're looking at,
%	but leave detailed discussion to the main body of the text.}
 %   \label{fig:example_figure}
%\end{figure}

% Example table
%\begin{table}
%	\centering
%	\caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
%	Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
%	\label{tab:example_table}
%	\begin{tabular}{lccr} % four columns, alignment for each
%		\hline
%		A & B & C & D\\
%		\hline
%		1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
%		2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\
%		3 & 5 & 7 & 9\\
%		\hline
%	\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


\section{Results}

\section{Discussion}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% REFERENCES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The best way to enter references is to use BibTeX:

\bibliographystyle{mnras}
\bibliography{example} % if your bibtex file is called example.bib


% Alternatively you could enter them by hand, like this:
% This method is tedious and prone to error if you have lots of references

\section{Some extra material}

If you want to present additional material which would interrupt the flow of the main paper,
it can be placed in an Appendix which appears after the list of references.
