	abstract = {We report on a coherent timing analysis of the 163 Hz accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J17062-6143. Using data collected with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer and XMM-Newton, we investigated the pulsar evolution over a time span of four years. We obtained a unique phase-coherent timing solution for the stellar spin, finding the source to be spinning up at a rate of (3.77 $\pm$ 0.09) × 10<SUP>-15</SUP> Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We further find that the 0.4-6 keV pulse fraction varies gradually between 0.5% and 2.5% following a sinusoidal oscillation with a 1210 $\pm$ 40 day period. Finally, we supplemented this analysis with an archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observation and obtained a phase-coherent model for the binary orbit spanning 12 yr, yielding an orbital period-derivative measurement of (8.4 $\pm$ 2.0) × 10<SUP>-12</SUP> s s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This large orbital period derivative is inconsistent with a binary evolution that is dominated by gravitational wave emission and is suggestive of highly nonconservative mass transfer in the binary system.},

	abstract = {The association of GW170817 with GRB170817A proved that electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave events are the key to deeply understand the physics of NS-NS merges. Upgrades of the existing GW antennas and the construction of new ones will allow to increase sensitivity down to several hundred Mpc vastly increasing the number of possible electromagnetic counterparts. Monitoring of the hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray sky with good localisation capabilities will help to effectively tackle this problem allowing to fully exploit multi-messenger astronomy. However, building a high energy all-sky monitor with large collective area might be particularly challenging due to the need to place the detectors onboard satellites of limited size. Distributed astronomy is a simple and cheap solution to overcome this difficulty. Here we discuss in detail dedicated timing techniques that allow to precisely locate an astronomical event in the sky taking advantage of the spatial distribution of a swarm of detectors orbiting Earth.},

	abstract = {We present a temporal analysis of the three outbursts of the X-ray millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 that occurred in 1998, 2000, and 2002. With a technique that uses the χ<SUP>2</SUP> obtained with an epoch-folding search to discriminate between different possible orbital solutions, we find an unique solution valid over the whole 5 yr period for which high temporal resolution data are available. We revise the estimate of the orbital period, P<SUB>orb</SUB>=7249.1569(1) s, and reduce the corresponding error by 1 order of magnitude with respect to that previously reported. Moreover, we report the first constraint on the orbital period derivative, -6.6×10<SUP>-12</SUP>&lt;P˙<SUB>orb</SUB>&lt;+0.8×10<SUP>-12</SUP> s s<SUP>-1</SUP>. These values allow us to produce, via a folding technique, pulse profiles at any given time. Analysis of these profiles shows that the pulse shape is clearly asymmetric in 2002, occasionally showing a secondary peak at about 145$\,^{\circ}$ from the main pulse, which is quite different from the almost sinusoidal shape reported at the beginning of the 1998 outburst.},

@article{Remillard:2021tt,
	abstract = {NICER has a comparatively low background rate, but it is highly variable, and its spectrum must be predicted using measurements unaffected by the science target. We describe an empirical, three-parameter model based on observations of seven pointing directions that are void of detectable sources. An examination of 3556 good time intervals (GTIs), averaging 570 s, yields a median rate (0.4-12 keV; 50 detectors) of 0.87 c/s, but in 5 percent (1 percent) of cases, the rate exceeds 10 (300) c/s. Model residuals persist at 20-30 percent of the initial rate for the brightest GTIs, implying one or more missing model parameters. Filtering criteria are given to flag GTIs likely to have unsatisfactory background predictions. With such filtering, we estimate a detection limit, 1.20 c/s (3 sigma, single GTI) at 0.4-12 keV, equivalent to 3.6e-12 erg/cm^2/s for a Crab-like spectrum. The corresponding limit for soft X-ray sources is 0.51 c/s at 0.3-2.0 keV, or 4.3e-13 erg/cm^2/s for a 100 eV blackbody. Faint-source filtering selects 85 percent of the background GTIs, and higher rates are expected for targets scheduled more favorably. An application of the model to 1 s timescale makes it possible to distinguish source flares from possible surges in the background.},

@article{Burderi:2002wk,
	abstract = {We present an evolutionary scenario for the spin-up and evolution of binary millisecond pulsars, according to which the companion of the pulsar PSR J1740-5340, recently discovered as a binary with orbital period of 32.5 hr in the globular cluster NGC 6397, is currently in a phase of ``radio-ejection'' mass loss from the system. The optical counterpart is a star as luminous as the cluster turnoff stars, but with a lower T<SUB>eff</SUB> (a larger radius), which we model with a star of initial mass compatible with the masses evolving in the cluster (~=0.85 M<SUB>solar</SUB>). This star has suffered Roche lobe overflow while evolving off the main sequence, spinning up the neutron star to the present period of 3.65 ms. At present, Roche lobe overflow due to the nuclear evolution of the pulsar companion and to systemic angular momentum losses by magnetic braking is still going on, but accretion is inhibited by the momentum exerted by the radiation of the pulsar on the matter at the inner Lagrangian point. The presence of this matter around the system is consistent with the long-lasting irregular radio eclipses seen in the system. Roche lobe deformation of the mass losing component is also necessary to be compatible with the optical light curve. The ``radio-ejection'' phase, which had been recently postulated by us to deal with the problem of the lack of submillisecond pulsars, can be initiated only if the system is subject to intermittency in the mass transfer during the spin-up phase. In fact, only when the system is detached is the pulsar radio emission not quenched and possibly able to prevent further mass accretion because of the action of the pulsar pressure at the inner Lagrangian point. We propose and discuss the idea that a plausible reason for the system to be expected to detach is the irradiation of the mass-losing component by the X-ray emission powered during the accretion phase. We finally discuss the consequences of the binary evolution leading to PSR J1740-5340, and its relation to other possible optical counterparts.},

	abstract = {We present a phase-coherent timing analysis of the intermittent accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021. A new timing solution for the pulsar spin period and the Keplerian binary orbital parameters was achieved by phase connecting all episodes of intermittent pulsations visible during the 2001 outburst. We investigate the pulse profile shapes, their energy dependence, and the possible influence of Type I X-ray bursts on the time of arrival and fractional amplitude of the pulsations. We find that the timing solution of SAX J1748.9-2021 shows an erratic behavior when selecting different subsets of data, which is related to substantial timing noise in the timing postfit residuals. The pulse profiles are very sinusoidal and their fractional amplitude linearly increases with energy, and no second harmonic is detected. The reason why this pulsar is intermittent is still unknown but we can rule out a one-to-one correspondence between Type I X-ray bursts and the appearance of the pulsations.},

	abstract = {We analysed all archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53 up to 2010 May. In 528 out of 1280 observations we detected kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs), with ∼65 per cent of these detections corresponding to the so-called lower kHz QPO. Using this QPO we measured, for the first time, the rate at which the QPO frequency changes as a function of QPO frequency. For this we used the spread of the QPO frequency over groups of 10 consecutive measurements, sampling time-scales between 320 and 1600 s and the time derivative of the QPO frequency, ν\dot QPO , over time-scales of 32-160 s. We found that (i) both the QPO-frequency spread and ν\dot QPO decrease by a factor of ∼3 as the QPO frequency increases. (ii) The average value of ν\dot QPO decreases by a factor of ∼2 as the time-scale over which the derivative is measured increases from less than 64 to 160 s. (iii) The relation between the absolute value of ν\dot QPO and the QPO frequency is consistent with being the same both for the positive and negative QPO-frequency derivatives. We show that, if either the lower or the upper kHz QPO reflects the Keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the accretion disc, these results support a scenario in which the inner part of the accretion disc is truncated at a radius that is set by the combined effect of viscosity and radiation drag.},

@article{Sanna:2010ux,
	abstract = {We analysed 866 observations of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1701-462 during its 2006-2007 outburst. XTE J1701-462 is the only example so far of a source that during an outburst showed, beyond any doubt, spectral and timing characteristics both of the Z and atoll type. There are 707 RXTE observations (~2.5 Ms) of the source in the Z phase and 159 in the atoll phase (~0.5 Ms). We found, respectively, pairs of kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) in eight observations during the Z phase and single kHz QPO in six observations during the atoll phase. Using the shift-and-add technique, we identified the QPO in the atoll phase as the lower kHz QPO. We found that the lower kHz QPO in the atoll phase has a significantly higher coherence and fractional rms amplitude than any of the kHz QPOs seen during the Z phase, and that in the same frequency range, atoll lower kHz QPOs show coherence and fractional rms amplitude, respectively, two and three times larger than the Z kHz QPOs. Out of the 707 observations in the Z phase, there is no single observation in which the kHz QPOs have a coherence or rms amplitude similar to those seen when XTE J1701-462 was in the atoll phase, even though the total exposure time was about five times longer in the Z than in the atoll phase. Since it is observed in the same source, the difference in QPO coherence and rms amplitude between the Z and atoll phase cannot be due to neutron star mass, magnetic field, spin, inclination of the accretion disc, etc. If the QPO frequency is a function of the radius in the accretion disc in which it is produced, our results suggest that in XTE J1701-462 the coherence and rms amplitude are not uniquely related to this radius. Here we argue that this difference is instead due to a change in the properties of the accretion flow around the neutron star. Regardless of the precise mechanism, our result shows that effects other than the geometry of space-time around the neutron star have a strong influence on the coherence and rms amplitude of the kHz QPOs, and therefore the coherence and rms amplitude of the kHz QPOs cannot be simply used to deduce the existence of the innermost stable circular orbit around a neutron star.},

	abstract = {Disc accretion to rotating stars with complex magnetic fields is investigated using full 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. The studied magnetic configurations include superpositions of misaligned dipole and quadrupole fields and off-centre dipoles. The simulations show that when the quadrupole component is comparable to the dipole component, the magnetic field has a complex structure with three major magnetic poles on the surface of the star and three sets of loops of field lines connecting them. A significant amount of matter flows to the quadrupole `belt', forming a ring-like hotspot on the star. If the maximum strength of the magnetic field on the star is fixed, then we observe that the mass accretion rate, the torque on the star and the area covered by hotspots are several times smaller in the quadrupole-dominant cases than in the pure dipole cases. The influence of the quadrupole component on the shape of the hotspots becomes noticeable when the ratio of the quadrupole and dipole field strengths B<SUB>q</SUB>/B<SUB>d</SUB> &gt;~ 0.5. It becomes dominant in determining the shape of the hotspots when B<SUB>q</SUB>/B<SUB>d</SUB> &gt;~ 1. We conclude that if the quadrupole component is larger than the dipole one, then the shape of the hotspots is determined by the quadrupole field component. In the case of an off-centre dipole field, most of the matter flows through a one-armed accretion stream, forming a large hotspot on the surface, with a second much smaller secondary spot. The light curves may have simple, sinusoidal shapes, thus mimicking stars with pure dipole fields. Or, they may be complex and unusual. In some cases, the light curves may be indicators of a complex field, in particular if the inclination angle is known independently. We also note that in the case of complex fields, magnetospheric gaps are often not empty, and this may be important for the survival of close-in exosolar planets.},

The calculation is the first to track fully the growth of high-order magnetic multipoles, due to equatorward hydromagnetic spreading, while simultaneously preserving flux-freezing and a self-consistent mass-flux distribution. Equilibria are constructed numerically by an iterative scheme and analytically by Green functions. Two key results are obtained, with implications for recycled pulsars.

	abstract = {The solutions of the two-dimensional hydromagnetic equations are used to calculate the torque on a magnetic neutron star accreting from a Keplerian disk. It is found that the magnetic coupling between the star and the plasma in the outer transition zone is appreciable; that as a result, the spin-up torque on fast rotators is substantially less than that on slow rotators, and that for sufficiently high stellar angular velocities or sufficiently low mass accretion rates, the rotation of the star can be braked while accretion continues. These results are applied to pulsating X-ray sources, revealing that at high luminosities a star of given spin period rotating in the same direction as the disk can experience either spin-up or spin-down, depending on its luminosity. Also considered are the general problem of interpreting period changes in pulsating X-ray sources, and the dipole magnetic moments of nine pulsating X-ray sources are estimated by fitting the theoretical spin-up equation to estimates of the average luminosity and spin-up rate of each source.},

	abstract = {In this paper we discuss the spin equilibrium of accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). We demonstrate that, when combined with a naive spin-up torque, the observed data lead to inferred magnetic fields which are at variance with those of Galactic millisecond radio pulsars. This indicates the need for either additional spin-down torques (e.g. gravitational radiation) or an improved accretion model. We show that a simple consistent accretion model can be arrived at by accounting for radiation pressure in rapidly accreting systems (above a few per cent of the Eddington accretion rate). In our model the inner disc region is thick and significantly sub-Keplerian and the estimated equilibrium periods are such that the LMXB neutron stars have properties that accord well with the Galactic millisecond radio pulsar sample. The implications for future gravitational-wave observations are also discussed briefly.},

Remarkably, they all rotate in a narrow range of frequencies (no more than a factor of 2, with many within 20% of 300 Hz). I suggest that these stars rotate fast enough so that, on average, the angular momentum added by accretion is lost to gravitational radiation. The strong ν<SUB>s</SUB>-dependence of the angular momentum loss rate from gravitational radiation then provides a natural reason for similar spin frequencies. Provided that the interior temperature has a large-scale asymmetry misaligned from the spin axis, then the temperature-sensitive electron captures in the deep crust can provide the quadrupole needed (~10<SUP>-7</SUP>MR<SUP>2</SUP>) to reach this limiting situation at ν<SUB>s</SUB>~300 Hz.

	abstract = {Timing noise in the data on accretion-powered millisecond pulsars (AMP) appears as irregular pulse phase jumps on timescales from hours to weeks. A large systematic phase drift is also observed in the first discovered AMP SAX J1808.4 - 3658. To study the origin of these timing features, we use here the data of the well studied 2002 outburst of SAX J1808.4 - 3658. We develop first a model for pulse profile formation accounting for the screening of the antipodal emitting spot by the accretion disk. We demonstrate that the variations of the visibility of the antipodal spot associated with the receding accretion disk cause a systematic shift in Fourier phases, observed together with the changes in the pulse form. We show that a strong secondary maximum can be observed only in narrow intervals of inner disk radii, which explains the very short appearance of the double-peaked profiles in SAX J1808.4 - 3658. By directly fitting the pulse profile shapes with our model, we find that the main parameters of the emitting spot, such as its mean latitude and longitude as well as the emissivity pattern, change irregularly causing small shifts in pulse phase, and the strong profile variations are caused by the increasing inner disk radius. We finally notice that significant variations in the pulse profiles in the 2002 and 2008 outbursts of SAX J1808.4 - 3658 happen at fluxes differing by a factor of 2, which can be explained if the inner disk radius is not a simple function of the accretion rate, but depends on the previous history.},

	abstract = {Precession in an accretion-powered pulsar is expected to produce characteristic variations in the pulse properties. Assuming surface intensity maps with one and two hotspots, we compute theoretically the periodic modulation of the mean flux, pulse-phase residuals and fractional amplitudes of the first and second harmonic of the pulse profiles. These quantities are characterized in terms of their relative precession phase offsets. We then search for these signatures in 37 d of X-ray timing data from the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338. We analyse a 12.2-d modulation observed previously and show that it is consistent with a freely precessing neutron star only if the inclination angle is , an a priori unlikely orientation. We conclude that if the observed flux variations are due to precession, our model incompletely describes the relative precession phase offsets (e.g. the surface intensity map is oversimplified). We are still able to place an upper limit on ɛ of 3.0 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP> independently of our model, and estimate the phase-independent tilt angle θ to lie roughly between 5$\,^{\circ}$ and 10$\,^{\circ}$. On the other hand, if the observed flux variations are not due to precession, the detected signal serves as a firm upper limit for any underlying precession signal. We then place an upper limit on the product ɛ cosθ of &lt;=9.9 × 10<SUP>-10</SUP>. The first scenario translates into a maximum gravitational wave strain of 10<SUP>-27</SUP> from XTE J1814-338 (assuming a distance of 8 kpc), and a corresponding signal-to-noise ratio of &lt;=10<SUP>-3</SUP> (for a 120 d integration time) for the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ground-based gravitational wave detector.},

	abstract = {X-ray timing of the accretion-powered pulsations during the 2003 outburst of the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338 has revealed variation in the pulse time of arrival residuals. These can be interpreted in several ways, including spin-down and wandering of the fuel impact point around the magnetic pole. In this Letter we show that the burst oscillations of this source are coherent with the persistent pulsations, to the level where they track all of the observed fluctuations. Only one burst, which occurs at the lowest accretion rates, shows a significant phase offset. We discuss what might lead to such rigid phase-locking between the modulations in the accretion and thermonuclear burst emission, and consider the implications for spin variation and the burst oscillation mechanism. Wandering of the fuel impact hot spot around a fixed magnetic pole seems the most likely cause for the accretion-powered pulse phase variations. This means that the burst asymmetry is coupled to the hot spot, not the magnetic pole. If premature ignition at this point (due to higher local temperatures) triggers a burning front that stalls before spreading over the entire surface, the resulting localized nuclear hot spot may explain the unusual burst and burst oscillation properties of this source.},

	abstract = {We have shown previously that many of the properties of persistent accretion-powered millisecond pulsars can be understood if their X-ray emitting areas are near their spin axes and move as the accretion rate and structure of the inner disk vary. Here, we show that this "nearly aligned moving spot model" may also explain the intermittent accretion-powered pulsations that have been detected in three weakly magnetic accreting neutron stars. We show that movement of the emitting area from very close to the spin axis to ~10$\,^{\circ}$ away can increase the fractional rms amplitude from lsim0.5%, which is usually undetectable with current instruments, to a few percent, which is easily detectable. The second harmonic of the spin frequency usually would not be detected, in agreement with observations. The model produces intermittently detectable oscillations for a range of emitting area sizes and beaming patterns, stellar masses and radii, and viewing directions. Intermittent oscillations are more likely in stars that are more compact. In addition to explaining the sudden appearance of accretion-powered millisecond oscillations in some neutron stars with millisecond spin periods, the model explains why accretion-powered millisecond oscillations are relatively rare and predicts that the persistent accretion-powered millisecond oscillations of other stars may become undetectable for brief intervals. It suggests why millisecond oscillations are frequently detected during the X-ray bursts of some neutron stars but not others and suggests mechanisms that could explain the occasional temporal association of intermittent accretion-powered oscillations with thermonuclear X-ray bursts.},

	abstract = {We investigate further a model of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars we proposed earlier. In this model, the X-ray-emitting regions of these pulsars are near their spin axes but move. This is to be expected if the magnetic poles of these stars are close to their spin axes, so that accreting gas is channeled there. As the accretion rate and the structure of the inner disk vary, gas is channeled along different field lines to different locations on the stellar surface, causing the X-ray-emitting areas to move. We show that this "nearly aligned moving spot model" can explain many properties of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, including their generally low oscillation amplitudes and nearly sinusoidal waveforms; the variability of their pulse amplitudes, shapes, and phases; the correlations in this variability; and the similarity of the accretion- and nuclear-powered pulse shapes and phases in some. It may also explain why accretion-powered millisecond pulsars are difficult to detect, why some are intermittent, and why all detected so far are transients. This model can be tested by comparing with observations the waveform changes it predicts, including the changes with accretion rate.},

	abstract = {Burst-only sources are X-ray sources discovered thanks to their bursting activity with no associated emission (at least with the monitoring instrument that led to their discovery). This bursting activity consists in one single short (tens of seconds to minutes) burst of X-ray emission, with spectral and timing properties consistent with thermonuclear (type I) bursts usually occurring on the surface of a neutron star. This likely provides a tight link between burst-only sources and neutron star X-ray binary transients. We carried out a series of snapshot observations of the entire sample of burst-only sources with the Swift satellite. We found a few sources in outburst and detected faint candidates, likely representing their quiescent counterparts. To provide a more comprehensive view, we analyzed data for three quasi-persistent faint X-ray binary transients, another sub-class closely related to burst-only sources. We discuss burst-only sources and quasi-persistent sources in the framework of neutron star transients, providing clues on their nature.},

	abstract = {Context. Since the discovery of the first accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) SAX J1808.4-3658 in 1998, the family of these sources has kept growing. Currently, it has 22 members. All AMXPs are transients with usually very long quiescence periods, implying that the mass accretion rate in these systems is quite low and not constant. Moreover, for at least three sources, a non-conservative evolution was also proposed. <BR /> Aims: Our purpose is to study the long term averaged mass-accretion rates in all the AMXPs discovered so far, to investigate a non-conservative mass-transfer scenario. <BR /> Methods: We calculated the expected mass-transfer rate under the hypothesis of a conservative evolution based on their orbital periods and on the (minimum) mass of the secondary star (as derived from the mass function), driven by gravitational radiation and/or magnetic braking. Using this theoretical mass transfer, we determined the expected accretion luminosity of the systems. Thus, we achieved the lower limit to the distance of the sources by comparing the computed theoretical luminosity and the observed flux averaged over a time period of 20 years. Then, the lower limit to the distance of the sources was compared to the value of the distance reported in the literature to evaluate how reasonable the hypothesis of a conservative mass transfer is. <BR /> Results: Based on a sample of 18 sources, we found strong evidence of a non-conservative mass transfer for five sources, for which the estimated distance lower limits are higher than their known distances. We also report hints of mass outflows in a further six sources. The discrepancy can be fixed under the hypothesis of a non-conservative mass transfer in which a fraction of the mass transferred onto the compact object is swept away from the system, likely due to the (rotating magnetic dipole) radiation pressure of the pulsar.},

	abstract = {The accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 has shown a peculiar orbital evolution in the past with an orbital expansion much faster than expected from standard binary evolutionary scenarios. Previous limits on the pulsar spin frequency derivative during transient accretion outbursts were smaller than predicted by standard magnetic accretion torque theory, while the spin evolution between outbursts was consistent with magnetic dipole spin-down. In this Letter, we present the results of a coherent timing analysis of the 2011 outburst observed by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer and extend our previous long-term measurements of the orbital and spin evolution over a baseline of 13 years. We find that the expansion of the 2 hr orbit is accelerating at a rate of \ddot P _b\simeq 1.6\times 10^ -20 \,s\,s^ -2  and we interpret this as the effect of short-term angular momentum exchange between the mass donor and the orbit. The gravitational quadrupole coupling due to variations in the oblateness of the companion can be a viable mechanism for explaining the observations. No significant spin frequency derivatives are detected during the 2011 outburst (|\dot \nu  |\lesssim 4\times 10^ -13 \,Hz\,s^ -1 ) and the long-term spin-down remains stable over 13 years with \dot \nu  \simeq -10^ -15 \,Hz\,s^ -1 .},

The very high value of {\.P}<SUB>orb</SUB> is compatible with a super-Eddington mass transfer rate from the companion star, as suggested by X-ray and optical data. The XMM-Newton observation taken in 2017 allows us to update the orbital ephemeris and verify whether the orbital period derivative has been stable over the past 40 yr. <BR /> Methods: We added two new values obtained from the Rossi-XTE (RXTE) and XMM-Newton observations performed in 2011 and 2017, respectively, to the X-ray eclipse arrival times from 1977 to 2008. We estimated the number of orbital cycles and the delays of our eclipse arrival times spanning 40 yr, using as reference time the eclipse arrival time obtained from the RXTE observation taken in 1996. <BR /> Results: Fitting the delays with a quadratic model, we found an orbital period P<SUB>orb</SUB> = 5.57062957(20) h and a {\.P}<SUB>orb</SUB> value of 1.475(54)×10<SUP>-10</SUP> s s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The addition of a cubic term to the model does not significantly improve the fit quality.

	abstract = {The accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 shows a peculiar orbital evolution that proceeds at a very fast pace. It is important to identify the underlying mechanism responsible for this behavior because it can help to understand how this system evolves and which physical processes (such as mass loss or spin-orbit coupling) are occurring in the binary. It has also been suggested that, when in quiescence, SAX J1808.4-3658 turns on as a radio pulsar, a circumstance that might provide a link between accreting millisecond pulsars and black-widow (BW) radio pulsars. In this work, we report the results of a deep radio pulsation search at 2 GHz using the Green Bank Telescope in 2014 August and an X-ray study of the 2015 outburst with Chandra, Swift XRT, and INTEGRAL. In quiescence, we detect no radio pulsations and place the strongest limit to date on the pulsed radio flux density of any accreting millisecond pulsar. We also find that the orbit of SAX J1808.4-3658 continues evolving at a fast pace. We compare the orbital evolution of SAX J1808.4-3658 to that of several other accreting and nonaccreting binaries, including BWs, redbacks, cataclysmic variables, black holes, and neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries. We discuss two possible scenarios: either the neutron star has a large moment of inertia and is ablating the donor, generating mass loss with an efficiency of 40%, or the donor star has a strong magnetic field of at least 1 kG and is undergoing quasi-cyclic variations due to spin-orbit coupling.},

The commonly accepted model for the formation of millisecond radio pulsars predicts the presence of a rapidly rotating, weakly magnetized neutron star in the core of these systems. The sudden drop in accretion rate associated with the end of an X-ray outburst causes the Alfv{\'e}n surface to move outside the light cylinder, allowing the pulsar emission process to operate. No pulsed signal was detected from the sources in our sample. We discuss several mechanisms that could hamper the detection and suggest that free-free absorption from material ejected from the system by the pulsar radiation pressure could explain our null result.},

	abstract = {Millisecond pulsars in tight binaries have recently opened new challenges in our understanding of physical processes governing the evolution of binaries and the interaction between astrophysical plasma and electromagnetic fields. Transitional systems that showed changes from rotation-powered to accretion powered states and vice versa have bridged the populations of radio and accreting millisecond pulsars, eventually demonstrating the tight evolutionary link envisaged by the recycling scenario. A decade of discoveries and theoretical efforts have just grasped the complex phenomenology of transitional millisecond pulsars from the radio to the gamma-ray band. This review summarises the main properties of the three transitional millisecond pulsars discovered so far, as well as of candidates and related systems, discussing the various models proposed to cope with the multifaceted behaviour.},

	abstract = {We present the first detection of X-ray coherent pulsations from the transitional millisecond pulsar XSS J12270-4859, while it was in a sub-luminous accretion disc state characterized by a 0.5-10 keV luminosity of 5 × 10<SUP>33</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> (assuming a distance of 1.4 kpc). Pulsations were observed by XMM-Newton at an rms amplitude of (7.7 $\pm$ 0.5) per cent with a second harmonic stronger than the fundamental frequency, and were detected when the source is neither flaring nor dipping. The most likely interpretation of this detection is that matter from the accretion disc was channelled by the neutron star magnetosphere and accreted on to its polar caps. According to standard disc accretion theory, for pulsations to be observed the mass inflow rate in the disc was likely larger than the amount of plasma actually reaching the neutron star surface; an outflow launched by the fast rotating magnetosphere then probably took place, in agreement with the observed broad-band spectral energy distribution. We also report about the non-detection of X-ray pulsations during a recent observation performed while the source behaved as a rotationally-powered radio pulsar.},

	abstract = {Millisecond radio pulsars acquire their rapid rotation rates through mass and angular momentum transfer in a low-mass X-ray binary system. Recent studies of PSR J1824-2452I and PSR J1023+0038 have observationally demonstrated this link, and they have also shown that such systems can repeatedly transition back-and-forth between the radio millisecond pulsar and low-mass X-ray binary states. This also suggests that a fraction of such systems are not newly born radio millisecond pulsars but are rather suspended in a back-and-forth, state-switching phase, perhaps for gigayears. XSS J12270-4859 has been previously suggested to be a low-mass X-ray binary, and until recently the only such system to be seen at MeV-GeV energies. We present radio, optical and X-ray observations that offer compelling evidence that XSS J12270-4859 is a low-mass X-ray binary which transitioned to a radio millisecond pulsar state between 2012 November 14 and December 21. We use optical and X-ray photometry/spectroscopy to show that the system has undergone a sudden dimming and no longer shows evidence for an accretion disc. The optical observations constrain the orbital period to 6.913 $\pm$ 0.002 h.},

	abstract = {Accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars (AMXPs) are an important subset of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in which coherent X-ray pulsations can be observed during occasional, bright outbursts (X-ray luminosity  L <SUB>  X</SUB>  ∼  10 <SUP>36</SUP>  erg     s   <SUP>-1</SUP>). These pulsations show that matter is being channeled onto the neutron star's magnetic poles. However, such sources spend most of their time in a low-luminosity, quiescent state ( L <SUB>  X</SUB>  ≲  10 <SUP>34</SUP>  erg     s   <SUP>-1</SUP>), where the nature of the accretion flow onto the neutron star (if any) is not well understood. Here we report that the millisecond pulsar/LMXB transition object PSR J1023+0038 intermittently shows coherent X-ray pulsations at luminosities nearly 100 times fainter than observed in any other AMXP. We conclude that in spite of its low luminosity, PSR J1023+0038 experiences episodes of channeled accretion, a discovery that challenges existing models for accretion onto magnetized neutron stars.},

	abstract = {We present radio and γ-ray observations, which, along with concurrent X-ray observations, reveal that the binary millisecond pulsar (MSP)/low-mass X-ray binary transition system PSR J1023+0038 has undergone a transformation in state. Whereas until recently the system harbored a bright millisecond radio pulsar, the radio pulsations at frequencies between 300 to 5000 MHz have now become undetectable. Concurrent with this radio disappearance, the γ-ray flux of the system has quintupled. We conclude that, though the radio pulsar is currently not detectable, the pulsar mechanism is still active and the pulsar wind, as well as a newly formed accretion disk, are together providing the necessary conditions to create the γ-ray increase. This system is the first example of a compact, low-mass binary which has shown significant state changes accompanied by large changes in γ-ray flux; it will continue to provide an exceptional test bed for better understanding the formation of MSPs as well as accretion onto neutron stars in general.},

	abstract = {Sufficiently low magnetic field neutron stars which accrete for long times from a surrounding keplerian disk can be spun up to millisecond periods. After accretion ceases, such stars could become isolated or binary pulsars, depending on whether their companions have subsequently disrupted the binary by either their tidal break ups or their supernova explosions. Such pulsars constitute a new class, with short periods, long apparent ages (P/{\.P} ≳ 10<SUP>8</SUP> yr) and pulsed optical, X-ray and γ-ray fluxes significantly below those expected for canonical pulsars with similar periods. Because of their long subsequent spin-down lifetimes, such pulsars would probably be observable if their birth rate exceeded even 10<SUP>-4</SUP> that of the canonical ones. We propose here that the recently discovered millisecond pulsar 4C21.53 belongs to this new class, together with the binaries PSRs 1913+16, 0820+02 and 0655+64, as well as possibly several isolated pulsars such as PSRs 1952+29 and 1804-08. The possibility of such a class of fast accretion-spun-up pulsars has also been noted by Backus et al.<SUP>1</SUP>.},

	abstract = {Ordinary radio pulsars are neutron stars with magnetic fields of ~10<SUP>12</SUP> gauss and spin periods in the range 0.1 to 3 seconds. In contrast, millisecond radio pulsars have much weaker fields (~10<SUP>9</SUP> gauss) and faster, millisecond spin rates. For both types of pulsar, the energy driving the radio pulsations is thought to be derived from the rotation of the neutron star. The star gradually `spins down' as energy is radiated away. Millisecond radio pulsars are often located in binary systems. In a widely accepted theoretical model,, they started as ordinary pulsars which lost most of their magnetic field and were `spun up' to millisecond periods by the accretion of matter from a companion star in an X-ray binary system. Evidence for this model has gradually mounted, but direct proof-in the form of the predicted coherent millisecond X-ray pulsations in the persistent flux of an X-ray binary has been lacking, despite many searches. Here we report the discovery of such a pulsar, confirming theoretical expectations. The source will probably become a millisecond radio pulsar when the accretion turns off completely.},

For each source we searched the archival RXTE data for the highest and lowest flux levels with a significant detection of pulsations. We assume these flux levels to correspond to the closest and farthest location of the inner edge of the accretion disc at which channelled accretion takes place. By estimating the accretion rate from the observed luminosity at these two flux levels, we place upper and lower limits on the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron star, using assumptions from standard magnetospheric accretion theory. Finally, we discuss how our field strength estimates can be further improved as more information on these pulsars is obtained.},

	abstract = {Magnetospheres of many astrophysical objects can be accurately described by the low-inertia (or ``force-free'') limit of MHD. We present a new numerical method for the solution of equations of force-free relativistic MHD based on the finite-difference time-domain approach, with a prescription for handling the spontaneous formation of current sheets. We use this method to study the time-dependent evolution of pulsar magnetospheres in both aligned and oblique magnetic geometries. For the aligned rotator, we confirm the general properties of the time-independent solution of Contopoulos et al. For the oblique rotator, we present the three-dimensional structure of the magnetosphere and compute, for the first time, the spin-down power of pulsars as a function of the inclination of the magnetic axis. We find that the pulsar spin-down luminosity is L~(μ<SUP>2</SUP>Ω<SUP>4</SUP><SUB>*</SUB>/c<SUP>3</SUP>) (1+sin<SUP>2</SUP>α), where μ is the stellar dipole moment, Ω<SUB>*</SUB> is the rotation frequency, and α is the magnetic inclination angle. We also discuss the effects of current sheet resistivity and reconnection on the structure and evolution of the magnetosphere.},

@article{Patruno:2010tm,
	abstract = {Accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars like IGR J00291+5934 are important because they can be used to test theories of pulsar formation and evolution. They give also the possibility of constraining gravitational wave emission theories and the equation of state of ultra-dense matter. Particularly crucial to our understanding is the measurement of the long-term spin evolution of the accreting neutron star. An open question is whether these accreting pulsars are spinning up during an outburst and spinning down in quiescence as predicted by the recycling scenario. Until now it has been very difficult to measure torques, due to the presence of fluctuations in the pulse phases that compromise their measurements with standard coherent timing techniques. By applying a new method, I am now able to measure a spin-up during an outburst and a spin-down during quiescence. I ascribe the spin-up (\dot ν _ su =5.1(3) × 10^ -13  Hz s^ -1 ) to accretion torques and the spin-down (\dot ν _sd-3.0(8)× 10^ -15  Hz s^ -1 ) to magneto-dipole torques, as those observed in radio pulsars. Both values fit in the recycling scenario and I infer the existence of a magnetic field for the pulsar of B ~= 2 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> G. No evidence for an enhanced spin-down due to gravitational wave emission is found. The accretion torques are smaller than previously reported, and there is strong evidence for an ordered process that is present in all outbursts that might be connected with a motion of the hot spot on the neutron star surface.},

References are given for all data listed. We have also developed a new World Wide Web interface for accessing and displaying either tabular or plotted data with the option of selecting pulsars to be displayed via logical conditions on parameter expressions. The Web interface has an ``expert'' mode giving access to a wider range of parameters and allowing the use of custom databases. For users with locally installed software and database on Unix or Linux systems, the catalog may be accessed from a command-line interface. C-language functions to access specified parameters are also available. The catalog is updated from time to time to include new information.},

	abstract = {We have identified the third known accretion-powered millisecond pulsar, XTE J0929-314, with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer. The source is a faint, high Galactic latitude X-ray transient (d&gt;~5 kpc) that was in outburst during 2002 April-June. The 185 Hz (5.4 ms) pulsation had a fractional rms amplitude of 3%-7% and was generally broad and sinusoidal, although occasionally double-peaked. The hard X-ray pulses arrived up to 770 μs earlier than the soft X-ray pulses. The pulsar was spinning down at an average rate of ν=(-9.2+/-0.4)×10<SUP>-14</SUP> Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP> the spin-down torque may arise from magnetic coupling to the accretion disk, a magnetohydrodynamic wind, or gravitational radiation from the rapidly spinning pulsar. The pulsations were modulated by a 43.6 minute ultracompact binary orbit, yielding the smallest measured mass function (2.7×10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>) of any stellar binary. The binary parameters imply an ~=0.01 M<SUB>solar</SUB> white dwarf donor and a moderately high inclination. We note that all three known accreting millisecond pulsars are X-ray transients in very close binaries with extremely low mass transfer rates. This is an important clue to the physics governing whether or not persistent millisecond pulsations are detected in low-mass X-ray binaries.},

	abstract = {A blue and variable optical counterpart of the X-ray transient XTE J0929-314 was identified on 2002 May 1. We conducted frequent BVRI broad-band photometry on this object using the Mt Canopus 1-m telescope during May and June until it had faded to below 21st magnitude. Nearly continuous I-band CCD photometry on 2002 May 2-4 revealed a ~10 per cent sinusoidal modulation at the binary period lasting ~6 cycles during the latter half of May 2. The phase indicates that the modulation may be due to a combination of emission by a hotspot on the disc and X-ray heating of the secondary. The emission generally trended bluer with B-I decreasing by 0.6 mag during the observations, but there were anomalous changes in colour during the first few days after optical identification when the I-band flux decreased slightly while fluxes in other bands increased. Spectral analysis of the BVRI broad-band photometry shows evidence of a variable excess in the R and I bands. We suggest that this may be due to synchrotron emission in matter flowing out of the system, and note that similar processes may have been responsible for anomalous V- and I-band measurements in 1998 of the persistent millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658.},

	abstract = {We report on the discovery of the second accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) in the globular cluster NGC 6440. Pulsations with a frequency of 205.89 Hz were detected with RXTE on 2009 August 30, October 1 and October 28, during the decays of lsim4 day outbursts of a newly X-ray transient source in NGC 6440. By studying the Doppler shift of the pulsation frequency, we find that the system is an ultra-compact binary with an orbital period of 57.3 minutes and a projected semimajor axis of 6.22 lt-ms. Based on the mass function, we estimate a lower limit to the mass of the companion to be 0.0067 M <SUB>sun</SUB> (assuming a 1.4 M <SUB>sun</SUB> neutron star). This new pulsar shows the shortest outburst recurrence time among AMXPs (~1 month). If this behavior does not cease, this AMXP has the potential to be one of the best sources in which to study how the binary system and the neutron star spin evolve. Furthermore, the characteristics of this new source indicate that there might exist a population of AMXPs undergoing weak outbursts which are undetected by current all-sky X-ray monitors. NGC 6440 is the only globular cluster to host two known AMXPs, while no AMXPs have been detected in any other globular cluster.},

After its main outburst in 2002, <ASTROBJ>XTE J1751-305</ASTROBJ> showed an additional three dim outbursts. We report on the timing analysis of the latest one, which occurred on October 8, 2009 and was serendipitously observed from its very beginning by RXTE. <BR /> Aims: By detecting the pulsation during more than one outburst, we derive a stronger constraint of the orbital parameters and their evolution, and we can track the secular spin frequency evolution of the source. <BR /> Methods: Using the RXTEdata of the last outburst of the AMP <ASTROBJ>XTE J1751-305</ASTROBJ>, we performed a timing analysis to more accurately constrain the orbital parameters. Because of the low quality of the data statistics, we applied an epoch-folding search technique to the whole data set to improve the local estimate of the time of ascending node passage. <BR /> Results: Using this new orbital solution, we epoch-folded data obtaining three pulse phase delays over a time span of 1.2 days, that we fitted using a constant spin frequency model. Comparing this barycentric spin frequency with that of the 2002 outburst, we obtained a secular spin frequency derivative of -0.55(12) × 10<SUP>-14</SUP> Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We estimate the pulsar's magnetic dipole value by assuming that the secular spin-down is due to a rotating magneto dipole emission, to be consistent with what is assumed for radio pulsars. We derive an estimate of the magnetic field strength at the polar cap of B<SUB>PC</SUB> = 4.0(4) × 10<SUP>8</SUP> G, for a neutron star mass of 1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, assuming the Friedman Pandharipande Skyrme equation of state.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of millisecond pulsations from the low-mass X-ray binary HETE J1900.1-2455, which was discovered by the detection of a type I X-ray burst by the High Energy Transient Explorer 2 (HETE-2). The neutron star emits coherent pulsations at 377.3 Hz and is in an 83.3 minute circular orbit with a companion of mass greater than 0.016 M<SUB>solar</SUB> and likely less than 0.07 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. The companion star's Roche lobe could be filled by a brown dwarf with no need for heating or nonstandard evolution. During one interval with an unusually high X-ray flux, the source produced quasi-periodic oscillations with a single peak at 883 Hz, and on subsequent days the pulsations were suppressed. We consider the distribution of spin versus orbital period in neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries.},

	abstract = {We present a study of the accretion flow to the intermittent accreting millisecond pulsar, HETE J1900.1-2455, based on observations made simultaneously by XMM-Newton and RXTE. The 0.33-50 keV energy spectrum is described by the sum of a hard Comptonized component produced in an optically thin τ ≃ 1 corona, a soft thermal kT<SUB>in</SUB> ≃ 0.2 keV component interpreted as accretion disc emission, and of disc reflection of the hard component. Two emission features are detected at energies of 0.98(1) and 6.58(7) keV, respectively. The latter is identified as Kα transition of Fe XXIII-XXV. A simultaneous detection in the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC-pn), EPIC-MOS2 and Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) spectra favours an astrophysical origin also for the latter, which has an energy compatible with Fe-Lα and helium-like Ne-Kα transitions. The broadness of the two features, σ/E ≃ 0.1, suggests a common origin, resulting from reflection in an accretion disc with inclination of (30<SUP>+ 4</SUP><SUB>- 3</SUB>)$\,^{\circ}$, and extending down to R<SUB>in</SUB> = 25<SUP>+ 16</SUP><SUB>- 11</SUB> gravitational radii from the compact object. However, the strength of the feature at lower energy measured by EPIC-pn cannot be entirely reconciled with the amplitude of the Fe-Kα line, hampering the possibility of describing it in terms of a broad-band reflection model, and preventing a firm identification. Pulsations at the known 377.3 Hz spin frequency could not be detected with an upper limit of 0.4 per cent at 3σ confidence level on the pulsed fractional amplitude. <P />We interpret the value of the inner disc radius estimated from spectral modelling and the lack of significant detection of coherent X-ray pulsations as an indication of a disc accretion flow truncated by some mechanism connected to the overall evolution of the accretion disc, rather than by the neutron star magnetic field. This is compatible with the extremely close similarity of spectral and temporal properties of this source with respect to other, non-pulsing atoll sources in the hard state.},

	abstract = {Aims:HETE J1900.1-2455 is the seventh known X-ray transient accreting millisecond pulsar and has been in outburst for more than one year. We compared the data on HETE J1900.1-2455 with other similar objects and made an attempt at deriving constraints on the physical processes responsible for a spectral formation. <BR />Methods: The broad-band spectrum of the persistent emission in the 2-300 keV energy band and the timing properties were studied using simultaneous INTEGRAL and publicly available RXTE data obtained in October 2005. The properties of the X-ray bursts observed from HETE J1900.1-2455 were also investigated. <BR />Results: The spectrum is well described by a two-component model consisting of a blackbody-like soft X-ray emission at 0.8 keV temperature and a thermal Comptonized spectrum with electron temperature of 30 keV and Thomson optical depth τ<SUB>T</SUB> ∼ 2 for the slab geometry. The source is detected by INTEGRAL up to 200 keV at a luminosity of 5×10<SUP>36</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> (assuming a distance of 5 kpc) in the 0.1-200 keV energy band. We have also detected one type I X-ray burst which shows photospheric radius expansion. The burst occurred at an inferred persistent emission level of ~3-4% of the Eddington luminosity. Using data for all X-ray bursts observed to date from HETE J1900.1-2455, the burst recurrence time is estimated to be about 2 days. No pulsations have been detected either in the RXTE or in the INTEGRAL data which puts interesting constraints on theories of magnetic field evolution in neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries.},

@article{Papitto:2013uf,
	abstract = {It is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accrete matter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up to millisecond rotational periods. During the accretion stage, the system is called a low-mass X-ray binary, and bright X-ray emission is observed. When the rate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, these binaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by the neutron star's rotating magnetic field. This evolutionary model is supported by the detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting neutron stars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered millisecond pulsar. It has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar may temporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems. Only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. Here we report observations of accretion-powered, millisecond X-ray pulsations from a neutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. Within a few days after a month-long X-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. This not only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the two states on very short timescales.},

@article{Di-Salvo:2020va,
	abstract = {Neutron Stars are among the most exotic objects in the Universe. A neutron star, with a mass of 1.4-2 Solar masses within a radius of about 10-15 km, is the most compact stable configuration of matter in which degeneracy pressure can still balance gravity, since further compression would lead to gravitational collapse and formation of a black hole. As gravity is extreme, rotation is extreme: neutron stars are the fastest rotating stars known, with periods as short as a millisecond. The presence of a magnetic field not aligned with the rotation axis of the star is the origin of pulsating emission from these sources, which for this reason are dubbed pulsars. The discovery in 1998 of the first Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar, started an exciting season of continuing discoveries. In the last 20 years, thanks to the extraordinary performance of astronomical detectors in the radio, optical, X-ray, and Gamma-ray bands, astrophysicists had the opportunity to thoroughly investigate the so-called Recycling Scenario: the evolutionary path leading to the formation of a Millisecond-spinning Pulsar. In this chapter we review the general properties of Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars, which provide the first evidence that neutron stars are spun up to millisecond periods by accretion of matter and angular momentum from a (low-mass) companion star. We describe the general characteristics of this class of systems with particular attention to their spin and orbital parameters, their short-term and long-term evolution, as well as the information that can be drawn from their X-ray spectra.},

	abstract = {As clocks, pulsars rival the best atomic clocks on Earth. Though the rest-frame `tick' rate (period P) of any given pulsar is unknown, the rest-frame rates of change of the periods are known to be very small. Therefore when they are observed to be large, one is quite certain that the rate of changes must be due to changing Doppler shifts: dot P  to acceleration, ddot P  to jerk, and periodic shifts to orbiting companion stars or planets. The first two give otherwise unobtainable information on the density and masses of the stellar remnants in the cores of globular clusters. The orbits of binary pulsars provide a test of the theory of the evolution of red giant stars, and in globular clusters provide the first direct evidence for the three- and four-body encounters which are believed to determine the dynamical evolution of globular clusters. The orbits of binary pulsars in our own Galaxy also show evidence for the fluctuations which the fluctuation-dissipation theorem implies should occur during the dissipative tidal circularization of orbits. And newtonian dynamical effects may soon add irrefutable confirmation to recent observations suggesting that some pulsars are surrounded by planetary systems similar to our own. There may not be life on their planets, but pulsars certainly breathe new life into the study of newtonian dynamical systems.},

	abstract = {MILLISECOND radio pulsars, which are old (~10<SUP>9</SUP>yr), rapidly rotating neutron stars believed to be spun up by accretion of matter from their stellar companions, are usually found in binary systems with other degenerate stars<SUP>1</SUP>. Using the 305-m Arecibo radiotelescope to make precise timing measurements of pulses from the recently discovered 6.2-ms pulsar PSR1257 +12 (ref. 2), we demonstrate that, rather than being associated with a stellar object, the pulsar is orbited by two or more planet-sized bodies. The planets detected so far have masses of at least 2.8 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> and 3.4 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> where M<SUB>⊕</SUB> is the mass of the Earth. Their respective distances from the pulsar are 0.47 AU and 0.36 AU, and they move in almost circular orbits with periods of 98.2 and 66.6 days. Observations indicate that at least one more planet may be present in this system. The detection of a planetary system around a nearby (~500 pc), old neutron star, together with the recent report on a planetary companion to the pulsar PSR1829-10 (ref. 3) raises the tantalizing possibility that a non-negligible fraction of neutron stars observable as radio pulsars may be orbited by planet-like bodies.},

	abstract = {Gravitationally bound three-body systems have been studied for hundreds of years and are common in our Galaxy. They show complex orbital interactions, which can constrain the compositions, masses and interior structures of the bodies and test theories of gravity, if sufficiently precise measurements are available. A triple system containing a radio pulsar could provide such measurements, but the only previously known such system, PSRB1620-26 (refs 7, 8; with a millisecond pulsar, a white dwarf, and a planetary-mass object in an orbit of several decades), shows only weak interactions. Here we report precision timing and multiwavelength observations of PSRJ0337+1715, a millisecond pulsar in a hierarchical triple system with two other stars. Strong gravitational interactions are apparent and provide the masses of the pulsar (1.4378(13), where is the solar mass and the parentheses contain the uncertainty in the final decimal places) and the two white dwarf companions (0.19751(15) and 0.4101(3)), as well as the inclinations of the orbits (both about 39.2$\,^{\circ}$). The unexpectedly coplanar and nearly circular orbits indicate a complex and exotic evolutionary past that differs from those of known stellar systems. The gravitational field of the outer white dwarf strongly accelerates the inner binary containing the neutron star, and the system will thus provide an ideal laboratory in which to test the strong equivalence principle of general relativity.},

Consequently, the derived values of the projected semimajor axis of the orbit and the longitude of orbital periastron have systematic errors that limit the precision of fundamental tests of relativistic gravity in the strong gravity field regime unless this effect is taken into account. On the other hand, possible observation of this effect with relativistic contributions calculated using general relativity may provide a tool for determining the orbital inclination and the longitude of the ascending node of the binary. This same technique may also be used in optical spectral observations of binary stars that possess a sufficiently high-quality determination of their radial velocity curve.},

We present the latest timing parameters for the system, including a significant change in the projected semi-major axis of the inner binary, a marginal detection of the fourth time derivative of the pulse frequency, and the pulsar proper motion (which is in agreement with published values for the proper motion of M4), and use them to further constrain the mass $m_2$ and the orbital parameters. Using the observed value of $\stackrel \ldots.  f $, we obtain a one-parameter family of solutions, all with $m_2 \lo 10^ -2 \,M_\odot$, i.e., excluding stellar masses. Varying $\stackrel \ldots.  f $ within its formal $1\sigma$ error bar does not affect the mass range significantly. However, if we vary $\stackrel \ldots.  f $ within a $4\sigma$ error bar, we find that stellar-mass solutions are still possible.

	abstract = {The millisecond pulsar PSR B1620-26, in the globular cluster M4, has a white dwarf companion in a half-year orbit. Anomalously large variations in the pulsar's apparent spin-down rate have suggested the presence of a second companion in a much wider orbit. Using timing observations made on more than 700 days spanning 11 yr, we confirm this anomalous timing behavior. We explicitly demonstrate, for the first time, that a timing model consisting of the sum of two noninteracting Keplerian orbits can account for the observed signal. Both circular and elliptical orbits are allowed, although highly eccentric orbits require improbable orbital geometries. The motion of the pulsar in the inner orbit is very nearly a Keplerian ellipse, but the tidal effects of the outer companion cause variations in the orbital elements. We have measured the change in the projected semimajor axis of the orbit, which is dominated by precession-driven changes in the orbital inclination. This measurement, along with limits on the rate of change of other orbital elements, can be used to significantly restrict the properties of the outer orbit. We find that the second companion most likely has a mass m~0.01 M<SUB>solar</SUB>--it is almost certainly below the hydrogen-burning limit (m&lt;0.036 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, 95% confidence)--and has a current distance from the binary of ~35 AU and orbital period of order 100 yr. Circular (and near-circular) orbits are allowed only if the pulsar magnetic field is ~3×10<SUP>9</SUP> G, an order of magnitude higher than a typical millisecond pulsar field strength. In this case, the companion has mass m~1.2×10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> and orbital period ~62 yr.},

By analysing the frequency modulation caused by the orbital motion observed between August 13 and September 8, 2011, we derive an orbital solution for the binary system with a period of 3.8432275(3) h. The measured mass function, f(M<SUB>2</SUB>,M<SUB>1</SUB>,i) = 0.00203807(8) M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, allows to set a lower limit of 0.17 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> on the mass of the companion star, while an upper limit of 0.48 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> is set by imposing that the companion star does not overfill its Roche lobe. We observe a marginally significant evolution of the signal frequency at an average rate of - (6.3 $\pm$ 1.9) × 10<SUP>-14</SUP> Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The low statistical significance of this measurement and the possible presence of timing noise hampers a firm detection of any evolution of the neutron star spin. We also present an analysis of the spectral properties of <ASTROBJ>IGR J17498 - 2921</ASTROBJ> based on the observations performed by the Swift-X-ray Telescope and the RXTE-Proportional Counter Array between August 12 and September 22, 2011.

We estimate the neutron star spin frequency and we refine the system orbital solution. To achieve the highest possible accuracy in the measurement of the spin frequency variation experienced by the source in-between the 2008 August outburst and the last outburst exhibited in 2004, we re-analysed the latter considering the whole data set available. We find that the source spins down during quiescence at an average rate of dot ν<SUB>sd</SUB>=(-4.1$\pm$1.2)×10<SUP>-15</SUP>  Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We discuss possible scenarios that can account for the long-term neutron star spin-down in terms of either magneto-dipole emission, emission of gravitational waves, and a propeller effect. If interpreted in terms of magneto-dipole emission, the measured spin down translates into an upper limit to the neutron star magnetic field, B ≲ 3 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> G, while an upper limit to the average neutron star mass quadrupole moment of Q ≲ 2 × 10<SUP>36</SUP> g cm<SUP>2</SUP> is set if the spin down is interpreted in terms of the emission of gravitational waves.},

	abstract = {Context. Timing analysis of accretion-powered millisecond pulsars (AMPs) is a powerful tool for probing the physics of compact objects. The recently discovered IGR J17511-3057 was the twelfth discovered of the 13 AMPs known. The Rossi XTE satellite provided an extensive coverage of the 25 days-long observation of the source outburst. <BR /> Aims: Our goal is to investigate the complex interaction between the neutron star magnetic field and the accretion disk by determining the angular momentum exchange between them. The presence of a millisecond coherent flux modulation allows us to investigate this interaction from the study of pulse arrival times. To separate the neutron star proper spin frequency variations from other effects, a precise set of orbital ephemeris is mandatory. <BR /> Methods: Using timing techniques, we analysed the pulse phase delays by fitting differential corrections to the orbital parameters. To remove the effects of pulse phase fluctuations, we applied the timing technique that had been already successfully applied to the case of an another AMP, XTE J1807-294. <BR /> Results: We report a precise set of orbital ephemeris. We demonstrate that the companion star is a main-sequence star. We find pulse phase delay fluctuations on the first harmonic with a characteristic amplitude of about 0.05, similar to those also observed for the AMP XTE J1814-338. For the second time, an AMP shows a third harmonic detected during the entire outburst. The first harmonic phase delays exhibit a puzzling behaviour, while the second harmonic phase delays clearly spin-up. The third harmonic also shows a spin-up, although not highly significant (3σ c.l.). The presence of a fourth harmonic is also reported. If we assume that the second harmonic is a good tracer of the spin frequency of the neutron star, we infer a mean spin frequency derivative for this source of 1.65(18) × 10<SUP>-13</SUP> Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: To interpret the pulse phase delays of the four harmonics, we apply the disk threading model, but obtain different and incompatible dot M  estimates for each harmonic. In particular, the phase delays of the first harmonic are heavily affected by phase noise, and consequently, on the basis of these data, it is not possible to derive a reliable estimate of dot M . The second harmonic gives a dot M  consistent with the flux assuming that the source is at a distance of 6.3 kpc. The third harmonic gives a lower dot M  value, with respect to the first and second harmonic, and this would reduce the distance estimate to 3.6 kpc.},

	abstract = {We have performed a timing analysis of the 2003 outburst of the accreting X-ray millisecond pulsar XTE J1807-294 as observed by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer. Using recently refined orbital parameters, we report for the first time a precise estimate of the spin frequency and of the spin frequency derivative. The phase delays of the pulse profile show a strong erratic behavior superposed on what appears to be a global spin-up trend. The erratic behavior of the pulse phases is strongly related to rapid variations of the light curve, making it very difficult to fit these phase delays with a simple formula. As in previous cases, we therefore separately analyze the phase delays of the first harmonic and of the second harmonic of the spin frequency, finding that the phases of the second harmonic are far less affected by the erratic behavior. Under the hypothesis that the second-harmonic pulse phase delays are a good tracer of the spin frequency evolution, we give for the first time an estimate of the spin frequency derivative for this source. XTE J1807-294 shows a clear spin-up of \dot ν   = 2.5(7) × 10<SUP>-14</SUP> Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP> (1 σ confidence level). The majority of the uncertainty in the value of the spin-up rate is due to the uncertainties in the source position on the sky. We discuss the effect of this systematic error on the spin frequency and its derivative.},

	abstract = {We have conducted timing observations of the eclipsing millisecond binary pulsar PSR~B1957+20, extending the span of data on this pulsar to more than five years. During this time the orbital period of the system has varied by roughly $\Delta P_b/P_b = 1.6 \times 10^ -7 $, changing quadratically with time and displaying an orbital period second derivative $\ddot P_b = (1.43 \pm 0.08) \times 10^ -18 \,$s$^ -1 $. The previous measurement of a large negative orbital period derivative reflected only the short-term behavior of the system during the early observations; the orbital period derivative is now positive and increasing rapidly. If, as we suspect, the PSR~B1957+20 system is undergoing quasi-cyclic orbital period variations similar to those found in other close binaries such as Algol and RS CVn, then the $0.025\,M _\odot $ companion to PSR~B1957+20 is most likely non-degenerate, convective, and magnetically active.},

	abstract = {It is proposed that a variable quadrupole moment produced by magnetic activity in the outer convection zone of one of the stars in a close binary is responsible for the orbital period changes which occur on a time scale of order 10 yr. In the model, magnetic activity modulates the orbital period, superposed on any long-term period changes that may occur. The model predicts that the orbital period changes should be periodic with the period of the activity cycle. If the period changes due to secular angular momentum loss and magnetic activity can be separated, a powerful new probe of stellar magnetic activity will emerge, tidal synchronization theory can be tested, and the progenitor population and evolution rate of cataclysmic variables can be determined.},

	abstract = {We present spectral and temporal properties of all the thermonuclear X-ray bursts observed from Aql X-1 by the Neutron Star Interior and Composition Explorer (NICER) between 2017 July and 2021 April. This is the first systematic investigation of a large sample of type I X-ray bursts from Aql X-1 with improved sensitivity at low energies. We detect 22 X-ray bursts including two short recurrence burst events in which the separation was only 451 s and 496 s. We perform time resolved spectroscopy of the bursts using the fixed and scaled background (f<SUB>a</SUB> method) approaches. We show that the use of a scaling factor to the pre-burst emission is the statistically preferred model in about 68 per cent of all the spectra compared to the fixed background approach. Typically the f<SUB>a</SUB> values are clustered around 1-3, but can reach up to 11 in a burst where photospheric radius expansion is observed. Such f<SUB>a</SUB> values indicate a very significant increase in the pre-burst emission especially at around the peak flux moments of the bursts. We show that the use of the f<SUB>a</SUB> factor alters the best-fitting spectral parameters of the burst emission. Finally, we employed a reflection model instead of scaling the pre-burst emission. We show that reflection models also do fit the spectra and improve the goodness of the fits. In all cases, we see that the disc is highly ionized by the burst emission and the fraction of the reprocessed emission to the incident burst flux is typically clustered around 20 per cent.},

@article{Burderi:2001wp,
	abstract = {The existence of ultrafast rotating neutron stars (spin period P&lt;~1 ms) is expected on the basis of current models for the secular evolution of interacting binaries, although they have not been detected yet. Their formation depends on the quantity of matter accreted by the neutron star which, in turn, is limited by the mechanism of mass ejection from the binary. An efficient mass ejection can avoid the formation of ultrafast pulsars or their accretion-induced collapse to a black hole. We propose that significant reductions of the mass transfer rate may cause the switch-on of a radio pulsar phase, whose radiation pressure may be capable of ejecting out of the system most of the matter transferred by the companion. This can prevent, for long orbital periods and if a sufficiently fast spin has been reached, any further accretion, even if the original transfer rate is restored, thus limiting the minimum spin period attainable by the neutron star. We show that close systems (orbital periods P<SUB>orb</SUB>~1 hr) are the only possible hosts for ultrafast spinning neutron stars. This could explain why ultrafast radio pulsars have not been detected so far, as the detection of pulsars with very short spin periods in close systems is hampered, in current radio surveys, by strong Doppler modulation and computational limitations.},

	abstract = {The optical counterpart of the binary millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 during quiescence was detected at V = 21.5 mag by Homer et al. (\cite Homer ). This star shows a 6% semi-amplitude sinusoidal modulation of its flux at the orbital period of the system. It was proposed that the modulation arises from X-ray irradiation of the intrinsically faint companion by a remnant accretion disk, and that the bulk of the optical emission arises from viscous dissipation in the disk. The serious difficulty in this scenario lies in the estimate of the irradiating luminosity required to match the observational data, that is a factor 10-50 higher than the quiescent X-ray luminosity of this source. To overcome this problem, we propose an alternative scenario, in which the irradiation is due to the release of rotational energy by the fast spinning neutron star, switched on, as magneto-dipole rotator (radio pulsar), during quiescence. Our computations indicate that the optical magnitudes are fully consistent with this hypothesis. In this case the observed optical luminosity may be the first evidence that a radio pulsar is active in this system in quiescence, a key phase for understanding the evolution of this class of objects.},

	abstract = {Context. The ultra-compact dipping source <ASTROBJ>XB 1916-053</ASTROBJ> has an orbital period of close to 50 min and a companion star with a very low mass (less than 0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). The orbital period derivative of the source was estimated to be 1.5(3) × 10<SUP>-11</SUP> s/s through analysing the delays associated with the dip arrival times obtained from observations spanning 25 years, from 1978 to 2002. <BR /> Aims: The known orbital period derivative is extremely large and can be explained by invoking an extreme, non-conservative mass transfer rate that is not easily justifiable. We extended the analysed data from 1978 to 2014, by spanning 37 years, to verify whether a larger sample of data can be fitted with a quadratic term or a different scenario has to be considered. <BR /> Methods: We obtained 27 delays associated with the dip arrival times from data covering 37 years and used different models to fit the time delays with respect to a constant period model. <BR /> Results: We find that the quadratic form alone does not fit the data. The data are well fitted using a sinusoidal term plus a quadratic function or, alternatively, with a series of sinusoidal terms that can be associated with a modulation of the dip arrival times due to the presence of a third body that has an elliptical orbit. We infer that for a conservative mass transfer scenario the modulation of the delays can be explained by invoking the presence of a third body with mass between 0.10-0.14 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, orbital period around the X-ray binary system of close to 51 yr and an eccentricity of 0.28 $\pm$ 0.15. In a non-conservative mass transfer scenario we estimate that the fraction of matter yielded by the degenerate companion star and accreted onto the neutron star is β = 0.08, the neutron star mass is ≥2.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and the companion star mass is 0.028 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. In this case, we explain the sinusoidal modulation of the delays by invoking the presence of a third body with orbital period of 26 yr and mass of 0.055 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. <BR /> Conclusions: From the analysis of the delays associated with the dip arrival times, we find that both in a conservative and non-conservative mass transfer scenario we have to invoke the presence of a third body to explain the observed sinusoidal modulation. We propose that XB 1916-053 forms a hierarchical triple system. <P />Table 1 is available in electronic form at <A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201526500/olm">http://www.aanda.org</A>},

@article{Wijnands:2009wa,
	abstract = {We present an analysis of the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and X-ray telescope (XRT) data of GRB060602B, which is most likely an accreting neutron star in a binary system and not a gamma-ray burst. Our analysis shows that the BAT burst spectrum is consistent with a thermonuclear flash (type I X-ray burst) from the surface of an accreting neutron star in a binary system. The X-ray binary nature is further confirmed by the report of a detection of a faint point source at the position of the XRT counterpart of the burst in archival XMM-Newton data approximately six year before the burst and in more recent XMM-Newton data obtained at the end of 2006 September (nearly four months after the burst). Since the source is very likely not a gamma-ray burst, we rename the source Swift J1749.4-2807, based on the Swift/BAT discovery coordinates. Using the BAT data of the type I X-ray burst, we determined that the source is at most at a distance of 6.7 +/- 1.3 kpc. For a transiently accreting X-ray binary, its soft X-ray behaviour is atypical: its 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity (as measured using the Swift/XRT data) decreased by nearly three orders of magnitude in about 1 day, much faster than what is usually seen for X-ray transients. If the earlier phases of the outburst also evolved this rapidly, then many similar systems might remain undiscovered because the X-rays are difficult to detect and the type I X-ray bursts might be missed by all the sky surveying instruments. This source might be part of a class of very fast transient low-mass X-ray binary systems of which there may be a significant population in our Galaxy.},

	abstract = {Context. The source X1822-371 is a low-mass X-ray binary system (LMXB) viewed at a high inclination angle. It hosts a neutron star with a spin period of ~0.59 s, and recently, the spin period derivative was estimated to be (-2.43 $\pm$ 0.05) × 10<SUP>-12</SUP> s/s. <BR /> Aims: Our aim is to address the origin of the large residuals below 0.8 keV previously observed in the XMM/EPIC-pn spectrum of X1822-371. <BR /> Methods: We analyse all available X-ray observations of X1822-371 made with XMM-Newton, Chandra, Suzaku and INTEGRAL satellites. The observations were not simultaneous. The Suzaku and INTEGRAL broad band energy coverage allows us to constrain the spectral shape of the continuum emission well. We use the model already proposed for this source, consisting of a Comptonised component absorbed by interstellar matter and partially absorbed by local neutral matter, and we added a Gaussian feature in absorption at ~0.7 keV. This addition significantly improves the fit and flattens the residuals between 0.6 and 0.8 keV. <BR /> Results: We interpret the Gaussian feature in absorption as a cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) produced close to the neutron star surface and derive the magnetic field strength at the surface of the neutron star, (8.8 $\pm$ 0.3) × 10<SUP>10</SUP> G for a radius of 10 km. We derive the pulse period in the EPIC-pn data to be 0.5928850(6) s and estimate that the spin period derivative of X1822-371 is (-2.55 $\pm$ 0.03) × 10<SUP>-12</SUP> s/s using all available pulse period measurements. Assuming that the intrinsic luminosity of X1822-371 is at the Eddington limit and using the values of spin period and spin period derivative of the source, we constrain the neutron star and companion star masses. We find the neutron star and the companion star masses to be 1.69 $\pm$ 0.13 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.46 $\pm$ 0.02 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively, for a neutron star radius of 10 km. <BR /> Conclusions: In a self-consistent scenario in which X1822-371 is spinning-up and accretes at the Eddington limit, we estimate that the magnetic field of the neutron star is (8.8 $\pm$ 0.3) × 10<SUP>10</SUP> G for a neutron star radius of 10 km. If our interpretation is correct, the Gaussian absorption feature near 0.7 keV is the very first detection of a CRSF below 1 keV in a LMXB.},

These calculations are based on the most recent description of the microphysics characteristic of these dense and cool objects and on the latest generation of grainless non-grey atmosphere models. We examine the evolution of the different mechanical and thermal properties of these objects as a function of mass and metallicity. We also demonstrate the inaccuracy of grey models and T(tau ) relationships under these conditions. We provide detailed tables of the mass-radius-luminosity-effective temperature relations for various ages and metallicities, aimed at calibrating existing or future observations of low-mass stars and massive brown dwarfs. We derive new hydrogen-burning minimum masses, within the afore-mentioned metallicity range. These minimum masses are found to be smaller than previous estimates, a direct consequence of non-grey effects. At last, we examine the evolution of the abundance of light elements, Li, Be and B, as a function of age, mass and metallicity.

	abstract = {Since the discovery of the first bona-fide brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets in 1995, the field of low-mass stars and substellar objects has progressed considerably, both from theoretical and observational viewpoints. Recent developments in the physics entering the modeling of these objects have led to significant improvements in the theory and to a better understanding of these objects' mechanical and thermal properties. This theory can now be confronted with observations directly in various observational diagrams (color-color, color-magnitude, mass-magnitude, mass-spectral type), a stringent and unavoidable constraint that became possible only recently with the generation of synthetic spectra. In this paper we present the current state-of-the-art general theory of low-mass stars and sub stellar objects, from one solar mass to one Jupiter mass, regarding primarily their interior structure and evolution. This review is a natural complement to the previous review by Allard et al (1997) on the atmosphere of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Special attention is devoted to the comparison of the theory with various available observations. The contribution of low-mass stellar and sub stellar objects to the Galactic mass budget is also analyzed.},

	abstract = {In this review, we summarize our present knowledge of the behaviour of the mass-radius relationship from solar-type stars down to terrestrial planets, across the regime of substellar objects, brown dwarfs and giant planets. Particular attention is paid to the identification of the main physical properties or mechanisms responsible for this behaviour. Indeed, understanding the mechanical structure of an object provides valuable information about its internal structure, composition and heat content as well as its formation history. Although the general description of these properties is reasonably well mastered, disagreement between theory and observation in certain cases points to some missing physics in our present modelling of at least some of these objects. The mass-radius relationship in the overlaping domain between giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs is shown to represent a powerful diagnostic to distinguish between these two different populations and shows once again that the present IAU distinction between these two populations at a given mass has no valid foundation.},

@article{Ge:2015ug,
	abstract = {In the limit of extremely rapid mass transfer, the response of a donor star in an interacting binary becomes asymptotically one of adiabatic expansion. We survey here adiabatic mass loss from Population I stars (Z = 0.02) of mass 0.10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>-100 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> from the zero-age main sequence to the base of the giant branch, or to central hydrogen exhaustion for lower main sequence stars. The logarithmic derivatives of radius with respect to mass along adiabatic mass-loss sequences translate into critical mass ratios for runaway (dynamical timescale) mass transfer, evaluated here under the assumption of conservative mass transfer. For intermediate- and high-mass stars, dynamical mass transfer is preceded by an extended phase of thermal timescale mass transfer as the star is stripped of most of its envelope mass. The critical mass ratio q<SUB>ad</SUB> (throughout this paper, we follow the convention of defining the binary mass ratio as q ≡ M<SUB>donor</SUB>/M<SUB>accretor</SUB>) above which this delayed dynamical instability occurs increases with advancing evolutionary age of the donor star, by ever-increasing factors for more massive donors. Most intermediate- or high-mass binaries with nondegenerate accretors probably evolve into contact before manifesting this instability. As they approach the base of the giant branch, however, and begin developing a convective envelope, q<SUB>ad</SUB> plummets dramatically among intermediate-mass stars, to values of order unity, and a prompt dynamical instability occurs. Among low-mass stars, the prompt instability prevails throughout main sequence evolution, with q<SUB>ad</SUB> declining with decreasing mass, and asymptotically approaching q<SUB>ad</SUB> = 2/3, appropriate to a classical isentropic n = 3/2 polytrope. Our calculated q<SUB>ad</SUB> values agree well with the behavior of time-dependent models by Chen &amp; Han of intermediate-mass stars initiating mass transfer in the Hertzsprung gap. Application of our results to cataclysmic variables, as systems that must be stable against rapid mass transfer, nicely circumscribes the range in q<SUB>ad</SUB> as a function of the orbital period in which they are found. These results are intended to advance the verisimilitude of population synthesis models of close binary evolution.},

	abstract = {We investigate the evolution of the stellar structure, when a star fills and overflows its Roche lobe in a circular, equatorial orbit around a supermassive black hole. The stellar mass-loss time-scale is anticipated to be long compared with the dynamical time-scale and short compared with the thermal time-scale of the star; so, the entropy as a function of enclosed mass is conserved. For a representative set of stars, we calculate how the stellar entropy, pressure, radius, density and orbital angular momentum vary when the star adiabatically loses mass. We also provide interpolated formulae of the stellar mean density in terms of the remaining stellar mass for different types of stars. As the stellar orbit changes with the stellar density, Sun-like stars, upper main-sequence stars and red giants will spiral inwards and then outwards, while lower main-sequence stars, brown dwarfs and white dwarfs will always spiral outwards. We discuss the validity and limitation of the adiabatic mass-loss assumption and show that such a mass-transfer process is always stable on dynamical time-scales when the mass ratio of the two objects is large.},

	abstract = {A new theoretical treatment of the evolution of highly compact binary systems is presented. The evolution is calculated until almost the entire mass of the secondary has been transferred to the primary or lost from the system. It is assumed that gravitational radiation from the system is the cause of mass transfer. It is found that the structure of the mass-losing star can be approximated by an n = 3/2 polytrope, and as a result a relatively large number of different cases can be explored and some general conclusions drawn. An explanation is found for the existence of a cutoff in the orbital period distribution among the cataclysmic variables and light is shed upon the possible generic relationships among cataclysmic variables, the low-mass X-ray binaries, and the spectrally soft transient X-ray sources.},

@article{Rappaport:2004tr,
	abstract = {The recent emergence of a new class of accretion-powered, transient, millisecond X-ray pulsars presents some difficulties for the conventional picture of accretion onto rapidly rotating magnetized neutron stars and their spin behavior during outbursts. In particular, it is not clear that the standard paradigm can accommodate the wide range in M (i.e., &gt;~ a factor of 50) over which these systems manage to accrete and the high rate of spin-down that the neutron stars exhibit in at least a number of cases. When the accretion rate drops sufficiently, the X-ray pulsar is said to become a ``fast rotator,'' and in the conventional view, this is accompanied by a transition from accretion to ``propellering,'' in which accretion ceases and the matter is ejected from the system. On the theoretical side, we note that this scenario for the onset of propellering cannot be entirely correct because it is not energetically self-consistent. We show that, instead, the transition is likely to take place through disks that combine accretion with spin-down and terminate at the corotation radius. We demonstrate the existence of such disk solutions by modifying the Shakura-Sunyaev equations with a simple magnetic torque prescription. The solutions are completely analytic and have the same dependence on M and α (the viscosity parameter) as the original Shakura-Sunyaev solutions, but the radial profiles can be considerably modified, depending on the degree of fastness. We apply these results to compute the torques expected during the outbursts of the transient millisecond pulsars and find that we can explain the large spin-down rates that are observed for quite plausible surface magnetic fields of ~10<SUP>9</SUP> G.},

Further, the rotational decay curve is found to satisfy the same law. It is further suggested that lithium depletion follows the same law but only as far as the Hyades age, after which the depletion proceeds exponentially. Since Ca+ emission is linearly proportional to magnetic field strength at the surface, one can predict that the surface fields are proportional to angular velocity and decay as the inverse square root.

	abstract = {MXB 1659-298 is a transient neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary system that shows eclipses with a periodicity of 7.1 h. MXB 1659-298 went to outburst in 2015 August, after 14 years of quiescence. We investigate the orbital properties of this source with a baseline of 40 years, obtained by combining the eight eclipse arrival times present in the literature with 51 eclipse arrival times collected during the last two outbursts. A quadratic ephemeris does not fit the delays associated with the eclipse arrival times and the addition of a sinusoidal term with a period of 2.31 $\pm$ 0.02 yr is required. We infer a binary orbital period of P = 7.1161099(3) h and an orbital period derivative of \dot P =-8.5(1.2) × 10^ -12  s s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We show that the large orbital period derivative can be explained with a highly non-conservative mass-transfer scenario, in which more than 98 per cent of the mass provided by the companion star leaves the binary system. We predict an orbital period derivative value of \dot P =-6(3) × 10^ -12  s s<SUP>-1</SUP> and constrain the companion-star mass between 0.3 and 1.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Assuming that the companion star is in thermal equilibrium, the periodic modulation can be due to either a gravitational quadrupole coupling arising from variations of the oblateness of the companion star or the presence of a third body of mass M<SUB>3</SUB> &gt; 21 Jovian masses.},

	abstract = {We report on a timing analysis performed on a 62-ks long XMM-Newton observation of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 during the latest X-ray outburst that started on September 21, 2008. By connecting the time of arrivals of the pulses observed during the XMM-Newton observation, we derived the best-fit orbital solution and a best-fit value of the spin period for the 2008 outburst. Comparing this new set of orbital parameters and, in particular, the value of the time of ascending-node passage with the orbital parameters derived for the previous four X-ray outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658 observed by the PCA onboard RXTE, we find an updated value of the orbital period derivative, which turns out to be dot P_orb = (3.89 $\pm$ 0.15) × 10<SUP>-12</SUP> s/s. This new value of the orbital period derivative agrees with the previously reported value, demonstrating that the orbital period derivative in this source has remained stable over the past ten years. Although this timespan is not sufficient yet for confirming the secular evolution of the system, we again propose an explanation of this behavior in terms of a highly non-conservative mass transfer in this system, where the accreted mass (as derived from the X-ray luminosity during outbursts) accounts for a mere 1% of the mass lost by the companion.},

	abstract = {Recent observations indicate that the eclipsing pulsar binary PSR B1957+20 undergoes alternating epochs of orbital period increase and decrease. We apply a model developed to explain orbital period changes of alternating sign in other binaries to the PSR B1957+20 system and find that it fits the pulsars observations well. The novel feature of the PSR B1957+20 system is that the energy flow in the companion needed to power the orbital period change mechanism can be supplied by tidal dissipation, making the companion the first identified tidally powered star. The flow of energy in the companion drives magnetic activity, which underlies the observed orbital period variations. The magnetic activity and the wind driven by the pulsar irradiation results in a torque on the spin of the companion. This torque holds the companion out of synchronous rotation, causing tidal dissipation of energy. We propose that the progenitor had a approximately 2 hr orbital period and a companion mass of 0.1-0.2 solar mass, and the system is evolving to longer orbital periods by mass and angular momentum loss on a timescale of 10<SUP>8</SUP> yr.},

@article{Iaria:2021um,
	abstract = {Context. The dipping source XB 1916-053 is a compact binary system with an orbital period of 50 min harboring a neutron star. It shows a positive and a negative superhump, which suggests the presence of a precessing elliptic accretion disk tilted with respect to the equatorial plane of the system. The orbital ephemeris indicates a large orbital period derivative, {\.P}/P = 1.53 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, that can be explained assuming a high non-conservative mass transfer rate. Finally, the spectrum shows prominent absorption lines indicating the presence of an ionized absorber along the line of sight. <BR /> Aims: Using ten new Chandra observations and one Swift/XRT observation, we are able to extend the baseline of the orbital ephemeris; this allows us to exclude some models that explain the dip arrival times. The Chandra observations provide a good plasma diagnostic of the ionized absorber and allow us to determine whether it is placed at the outer rim of the accretion disk or closer to the compact object. <BR /> Methods: From the available observations we are able to obtain three new dip arrival times extending the baseline of the orbital ephemeris from 37 to 40 years. The Chandra spectra are fitted adopting a Comptonized continuum. To fit the absorption lines we adopt the ZXIPCF component obtaining information on the ionization parameter and the equivalent hydrogen column density of the ionized absorber. <BR /> Results: From the analysis of the dip arrival times we confirm an orbital period derivative of {\.P} = 1.46(3) × 10<SUP>-11</SUP> s s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, the unabsorbed 0.1-100 keV luminosity observed from the Chandra spectra show a variation between 3 × 10<SUP>36</SUP> and 1.4 × 10<SUP>37</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We show that the {\.P} value and the luminosity values are compatible with neutron star masses higher than 1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> with a mass accretion rate lower than 10% of the mass transfer rate. We show that the mass ratio q = m<SUB>2</SUB>/m<SUB>1</SUB> of 0.048 explains the apsidal precession period of 3.9 d and the nodal precession period of 4.86 d deduced from the superhump and infrahump detected period. The observed absorption lines are associated with the presence of Ne X, Mg XII, Si XIV, SXVI, and Fe XXVI ions. We observe a redshift in the absorption lines between 1.1 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> and 1.3 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP>. By interpreting it as gravitational redshift, as recently discussed in the literature, we find that the ionized absorber is placed at a distance of 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm from the neutron star with a mass of 1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and has a hydrogen atom density greater than 10<SUP>15</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Instead, the absorber is more distant and could be placed at the outer rim of the accretion disk (1.7 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> cm) during the dip activity. <BR /> Conclusions: We show that the mass ratio of the source is 0.048; this value is obtained from the nodal precession period of the disk and from the apsidal precession period taking into account the pressure term due to the spiral wave present in the disk. From our analysis we estimate a pitch angle of the spiral wave smaller than 30$\,^{\circ}$, in agreement with the values observed in several cataclysmic variables. We show that the outer radius of the disk is truncated at the radius in which a 3:1 resonance occurs, which is 1.7 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> cm for a neutron star mass of 1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The large orbital period derivative is likely due to a high non-conservative mass transfer with a mass transfer rate of 10<SUP>-8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The variation in observed luminosity could be explained assuming that the ejection point from which the matter leaves the system moves close to the inner Lagrangian point.},

	abstract = {The measurement of the spin frequency in accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars (AMXPs) is strongly affected by the presence of an unmodeled component in the pulse arrival times called "timing noise." We show that it is possible to attribute much of this timing noise to a pulse phase offset that varies in correlation with X-ray flux, such that noise in flux translates into timing noise. This could explain many of the pulse frequency variations previously interpreted in terms of true spin-up or spin-down, and would bias measured spin frequencies. Spin frequencies improved under this hypothesis are reported for six AMXPs. The effect would most easily be accounted for by an accretion-rate-dependent hot spot location.},

	abstract = {We analysed a 115-ks XMM-Newton observation and the stacking of 8 d of INTEGRAL observations, taken during the raise of the 2015 outburst of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021. The source showed numerous type-I burst episodes during the XMM-Newton observation, and for this reason we studied separately the persistent and burst epochs. We described the persistent emission with a combination of two soft thermal components, a cold thermal Comptonization component (∼2 keV) and an additional hard X-ray emission described by a power law (Γ ∼ 2.3). The continuum components can be associated with an accretion disc, the neutron star (NS) surface and a thermal Comptonization emission coming out of an optically thick plasma region, while the origin of the high-energy tail is still under debate. In addition, a number of broad (σ = 0.1-0.4 keV) emission features likely associated with reflection processes have been observed in the XMM-Newton data.

We suggest that the spectral properties of SAX J1748.9-2021 are consistent with a soft state, differently from many other accreting X-ray millisecond pulsars which are usually found in the hard state. Moreover, none of the observed type-I burst reached the Eddington luminosity. Assuming that the burst ignition and emission are produced above the whole NS surface, we estimate an NS radius of ∼7-8 km, consistent with previous results.},

	abstract = {Torque fluctuations which can lead to variations in the periods of pulsating X-ray sources are examined. A description of torque variations in terms of noise processes is developed, and the resulting noise models are applied to observations of several pulsating X-ray sources. It is shown that fluctuations in accretion torque could account for the observed period variations and spindown episodes in Her X-1 and Cen X-3. The values of the torque noise strengths inferred from either a nonresonant response or, in the case of Her X-1, a Tkachenko-mode interpretation of the data are found to be consistent with those expected from processes at the magnetospheric boundary of an accreting neutron star. Ways to distinguish among the various interpretations of the period variations are considered. It is noted that fluctuating mass-flow rates may be responsible for other phenomena observed in compact X-ray sources, such as wobble with zero initial amplitude and binary period variations in close binary systems experiencing mass transfer.},

	abstract = {The first discovered accreting millisecond pulsar, SAX J1808.4-3658, went into X-ray outburst in 2015 April. We triggered a 100 ks XMM-Newton ToO, taken at the peak of the outburst, and a 55 ks NuSTAR ToO, performed 4 d apart. We report here the results of a detailed spectral analysis of both the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectra. While the XMM-Newton spectrum appears much softer than in previous observations, the NuSTAR spectrum confirms the results obtained with XMM-Newton during the 2008 outburst. We find clear evidence of a broad iron line that we interpret as produced by reflection from the inner accretion disc. For the first time, we use a self-consistent reflection model to fit the reflection features in the NuSTAR spectrum; in this case, we find a statistically significant improvement of the fit with respect to a simple Gaussian or diskline model to fit the iron line, implying that the reflection continuum is also significantly detected. Despite the differences evident between the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectra, the smearing best-fitting parameters found for these spectra are consistent with each other and are compatible with previous results. In particular, we find an upper limit to the inner disc radius of ∼12R<SUB>g</SUB>. In all the cases, a high inclination angle (&gt;50$\,^{\circ}$) of the system is required. This inclination angle, combined with measurements of the radial velocity of the optical companion, results in a low value for the neutron star mass (&lt; 0.8 M_⊙), a result that deserves further investigation.},

The sinusoidal fractional amplitudes of the pulsations are the highest observed among AMXPs and can reach values of up to 27% (2.5-30 keV). The pulse arrival time residuals of the fundamental frequency follow a linear anti-correlation with the fractional amplitudes that suggests hot spot motion both in longitude and latitude over the surface of the neutron star. An anti-correlation between residuals and X-ray flux suggests an influence of the accretion rate on pulse phase and casts doubts on the interpretation of pulse frequency derivatives in terms of changes of spin rates and torques on the neutron star.},

We review accretion torque theory, the pulse formation process, and how AMXP observations have changed our view on the interaction of plasma and magnetic fields in strong gravity. We also explain how the AMXPs have deepened our understanding of the thermonuclear burst process, in particular the phenomenon of burst oscillations.

From a detailed spectral and timing analysis of the coherent pulsations we find that they show a strong energy dependence, with soft thermal emission lagging about 640 μs behind the hard, Comptonized emission. Additionally, we observe uncommonly large pulse fractions, with measured amplitudes in excess of 20% sinusoidal fractional amplitude across the NICER passband and fluctuations of up to ∼70%. Based on a phase-resolved spectral analysis, we suggest that these extreme properties might be explained if the source has an unusually favorable viewing geometry with a large magnetic misalignment angle. Due to these large pulse fractions, we were able to detect pulsations down to quiescent luminosities (∼ 5×  10 <SUP>33</SUP> erg    s   <SUP>-1</SUP>). We discuss these low-luminosity pulsations in the context of transitional millisecond pulsars.},

	abstract = {The accreting millisecond pulsars IGR J00291+5934 and SAX J1808.4-3658 are two compact binaries with very similar orbital parameters. The latter has been observed to evolve on a very short timescale of ∼70 Myr, which is more than an order of magnitude shorter than expected. There is an ongoing debate on the possibility that the pulsar spin-down power ablates the companion, generating large amounts of mass-loss in the system. Therefore it is interesting to study whether IGR J00291+5934 does show a similar behavior as its twin system SAX J1808.4-3658. In this work we present the first constraints on the orbital period derivative of IGR J00291+5934. By using XMM-Newton data recorded during the 2015 outburst and adding the previous results of the 2004 and 2008 outbursts, we are able to measure a 90% confidence level allowed range of -5×  10 <SUP>-13</SUP>&lt;  \dot P  <SUB>b</SUB>&lt; 6×  10 <SUP>-13</SUP>. This implies that the binary is evolving on a timescale longer than 0.5 Gyr, which is compatible with the expected timescale of mass transfer driven by angular momentum loss via gravitational radiation. We discuss the scenario in which the power loss from magnetic dipole radiation of the neutron star is hitting the companion star. If this model is applied to SAX J1808.4-3658, then the difference in orbital behavior can be ascribed to a different efficiency for the conversion of the spin-down power into energetic relativistic pulsar wind and X-ray/gamma-ray radiation for the two pulsars, with IGR J00291+5934 requiring an extraordinarily low efficiency of less than ∼5% to explain the observations. We thus conclude that the pulsar wind ablation model is unlikely to be an accurate description of the mechanism driving the orbital evolution of the two systems.},

	abstract = {We study the current sample of rapidly rotating neutron stars in both accreting and non-accreting binaries in order to determine whether the spin distribution of accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) can be reconciled with current accretion torque models. We perform a statistical analysis of the spin distributions and show that there is evidence for two subpopulations among LMXBs, one at a relatively low spin frequency, with an average of ≈ 300  Hz  and a broad spread, and a peaked population at higher frequency with an average spin frequency of ≈ 575  Hz . We show that the two subpopulations are separated by a cut-point at a frequency of ≈ 540  Hz . We also show that the spin frequency of radio millisecond pulsars (RMSPs) does not follow a log-normal distribution and shows no evidence for the existence of distinct subpopulations. We discuss the uncertainties of different accretion models and speculate that either the accreting neutron star cut-point marks the onset of gravitational waves as an efficient mechanism to remove angular momentum or some of the neutron stars in the fast subpopulation do not evolve into RMSPs.},

	abstract = {Context. The burst-only source Swift J1749.4-2807 was discovered in a high X-ray-active state, during an INTEGRAL observations of the Galactic bulge on 2010 April 10. Pulsations at 518 Hz were discovered in the RXTE data, confirming previous suggestions of possible associations between burst-only sources and accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars. The subsequent discovery of X-ray eclipses made Swift J1749.4-2807 the first eclipsing accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar. <BR /> Aims: We obtain additional information on Swift J1749.4-2807 and other burst-only sources. <BR /> Methods: We report on the results of a monitoring campaign on the source, carried out for about two weeks with the Swift, INTEGRAL, and RXTE satellites. <BR /> Results: The observations showed that the X-ray spectrum (energy range 0.5-40 keV) of Swift J1749.4-2807 during the entire event was accurately modeled by an absorbed power-law model (N<SUB>H</SUB> ≃ 3 × 10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, Γ ≃ 1.7). X-ray eclipses were also detected in the Swift data and provides a clear evidence of a dust-scattering halo located along the line of sight to the source. Only one type-I X-ray burst was observed throughout the two-weeks long monitoring. The X-ray flux of Swift J1749.4-2807 decayed below the detection threshold of Swift /XRT about 11 days after the discovery, in a exponential fashion (e-folding time of τ = 12<SUP>+7</SUP><SUB>-3</SUB> days). <BR /> Conclusions: We compare the properties of the outburst observed from Swift J1749.4-2807 with those of the previously known millisecond X-ray pulsars and other transient low mass X-ray binaries.},

	abstract = {We report on a 63-ks long XMM-Newton observation of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 during the latest X-ray outburst which started on September 21st 2008. The pn spectrum shows a highly significant emission line in the energy band where the iron K-α line is expected, and which we identify as emission from neutral (or mildly ionized) iron. The line profile appears to be quite broad (more than 1 keV FWHM) and asymmetric; the most probable explanation for this profile is Doppler and relativistic broadening from the inner accretion disc. From a fit with a diskline profile we find an inner radius of the disc of 8.7<SUP>+3.7</SUP><SUB>-2.7</SUB>~R_g, corresponding to 18.0<SUP>+7.6</SUP><SUB>-5.6</SUB> km for a 1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> neutron star. The disc therefore appears truncated inside the corotation radius (31 km for SAX J1808.4-3658) in agreement with the fact that the source was still showing pulsations during the XMM-Newton observation.},

	abstract = {We present results of recent Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) IGR J17062-6143 that show that it resides in a circular, ultracompact binary with a 38-minute orbital period. NICER observed the source for ≈26 ks over a 5.3-day span in 2017 August, and again for 14 and 11 ks in 2017 October and November, respectively. A power spectral analysis of the August exposure confirms the previous detection of pulsations at 163.656 Hz in Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data, and reveals phase modulation due to orbital motion of the neutron star. A coherent search for the orbital solution using the Z <SUP>2</SUP> method finds a best-fitting circular orbit with a period of 2278.21 s (37.97 minutes), a projected semimajor axis of 0.00390 lt-s, and a barycentric pulsar frequency of 163.6561105 Hz. This is currently the shortest known orbital period for an AMXP. The mass function is 9.12 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, presently the smallest known for a stellar binary. The minimum donor mass ranges from ≈0.005 to 0.007 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> for a neutron star mass from 1.2 to 2 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Assuming mass transfer is driven by gravitational radiation, we find donor mass and binary inclination bounds of 0.0175-0.0155 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and 19$\,^{\circ}$ &lt; i &lt; 27.$\,^{\circ}$5, where the lower and upper bounds correspond to 1.4 and 2 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> neutron stars, respectively. Folding the data accounting for the orbital modulation reveals a sinusoidal profile with fractional amplitude 2.04 $\pm$ 0.11% (0.3-3.2 keV).},

	abstract = {We report on the discovery of coherent pulsations at a period of 2.9 ms from the X-ray transient MAXI J0911-655 in the globular cluster NGC 2808. We observed X-ray pulsations at a frequency of 339.97 Hz in three different observations of the source performed with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR during the source outburst. This newly discovered accreting millisecond pulsar is part of an ultra-compact binary system characterised by an orbital period of 44.3 min and a projected semi-major axis of 17.6 lt-ms. Based on the mass function, we estimate a minimum companion mass of 0.024 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, which assumes a neutron star mass of 1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a maximum inclination angle of 75$\,^{\circ}$ (derived from the lack of eclipses and dips in the light-curve of the source). We find that the Roche-lobe of the companion star could either be filled by a hot (5 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> K) pure helium white dwarf with a 0.028 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> mass (implying I ≃ 58$\,^{\circ}$) or an old (&gt;5 Gyr) brown dwarf with metallicity abundances between solar/sub-solar and mass ranging in the interval 0.065 to 0.085 (16 &lt; I &lt; 21). During the outburst, the broad-band energy spectra are well described by a superposition of a weak black-body component (kT 0.5 keV) and a hard cut-off power-law with photon index Γ 1.7 and cut-off at a temperature kT<SUB>e</SUB> 130 keV. Up until the latest Swift-XRT observation performed on 19th July, 2016, the source had been observed in outburst for almost 150 days, which makes MAXI J0911-655 the second accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar with outburst duration longer than 100 days.},

	abstract = {The Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) is a proposed NASA Explorer Mission of Opportunity dedicated to the study of the extraordinary gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear-physics environments embodied by neutron stars. NICER will explore the exotic states of matter within neutron stars, where density and pressure are higher than in atomic nuclei, confronting theory with unique observational constraints. NICER will enable rotation-resolved spectroscopy of the thermal and non-thermal emissions of neutron stars in the soft (0.2-12 keV) X-ray band with unprecedented sensitivity, probing interior structure, the origins of dynamic phenomena, and the mechanisms that underlie the most powerful cosmic particle accelerators known. NICER will achieve these goals by deploying, following launch in December 2016, an X-ray timing and spectroscopy instrument as an attached payload aboard the International Space Station (ISS). A robust design compatible with the ISS visibility, vibration, and contamination environments allows NICER to exploit established infrastructure with low risk. Grazing-incidence optics coupled with silicon drift detectors, actively pointed for a full hemisphere of sky coverage, will provide photon-counting spectroscopy and timing registered to GPS time and position, with high throughput and relatively low background. In addition to advancing a vital multi-wavelength approach to neutron star studies through coordination with radio and γ-ray observations, NICER will provide a rapid-response capability for targeting of transients, continuity in X-ray timing astrophysics investigations post-RXTE through a proposed Guest Observer program, and new discovery space in soft X-ray timing science.},

	abstract = {We present a precise timing analysis of the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338 during its 2003 outburst, observed by RXTE. A full orbital solution is given for the first time; Doppler effects induced by the motion of the source in the binary system were corrected, leading to a refined estimate of the orbital period, P<SUB>orb</SUB> = 15388.7229(2) s, and of the projected semimajor axis, a sini/c = 0.390633(9) light-second. We could then investigate the spin behaviour of the accreting compact object during the outburst. We report here a refined value of the spin frequency (ν = 314.35610879(1) Hz) and the first estimate of the spin frequency derivative of this source while accreting . This spin-down behaviour arises when both the fundamental frequency and the second harmonic are taken into consideration. We discuss this in the context of the interaction between the disc and the quickly rotating magnetosphere, at accretion rates sufficiently low to allow a threading of the accretion disc in regions where the Keplerian velocity is slower than the magnetosphere velocity. We also present indications of a jitter of the pulse phases around the mean trend, which we argue results from movements of the accreting hotspots in response to variations of the accretion rate.},

We show under which conditions this method can be applied along with the results obtained applying this method to the 2003 outburst observed by RXTE of the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1807-294 which shows in its phase delays a non-negligible erratic behaviour. We refined the orbital parameters of XTE J1807-294 using all the 90 days in which the pulsation is strongly detected and the method applicable. In this way, we obtain the orbital parameters of the source with a precision more than one order of magnitude better than the previous available orbital solution, a precision obtained to date, on accreting millisecond pulsars, only for SAX J1808.4-3658 analysing several outbursts spanning over seven years and with much better statistics.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer Proportional Counter Array of a second transient accreting millisecond pulsar, XTE J1751-305, during regular monitoring observations of the Galactic bulge region. The pulsar has a spin frequency of 435 Hz, making it one of the fastest pulsars. The pulsations contain the signature of orbital Doppler modulation, which implies an orbital period of 42 minutes, the shortest orbital period of any known radio or X-ray millisecond pulsar. The mass function, f<SUB>X</SUB>=(1.278+/-0.003)×10<SUP>-6</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, yields a minimum mass for the companion of between 0.013 and 0.017 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, depending on the mass of the neutron star. No eclipses were detected. A previous X-ray outburst in 1998 June was discovered in archival All-Sky Monitor data. Assuming mass transfer in this binary system is driven by gravitational radiation, we constrain the orbital inclination to be in the range 30$\,^{\circ}$-85$\,^{\circ}$ and the companion mass to be 0.013-0.035 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. The companion is most likely a heated helium dwarf. We also present results from the Chandra High Resolution Camera-S observations, which provide the best-known position of XTE J1751-305.},

	abstract = {We report on the coherent timing analysis of the 182 Hz accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar Swift J1756.9-2508 during its 2018 outburst as observed with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). Combining our NICER observations with Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the 2007 and 2009 outbursts, we also studied the long-term spin and orbital evolution of this source. We find that the binary system is well described by a constant orbital period model, with an upper limit on the orbital period derivative of |  \dot P  <SUB>b</SUB>| &lt; 7.4×  10 <SUP>-13</SUP> s s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Additionally, we improve upon the source coordinates through astrometric analysis of the pulse arrival times, finding R.A. = 17<SUP>h</SUP>56<SUP>m</SUP>57.ˢ18 $\pm$ 0.ˢ08 and decl. = -25$\,^{\circ}$06‧27.″8 $\pm$ 3.″5, while simultaneously measuring the long-term spin frequency derivative as \dot ν  =-7.3×  10 <SUP>-16</SUP> Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We briefly discuss the implications of these measurements in the context of the wider population of accreting millisecond pulsars.},

	abstract = {We report on the spectral and timing properties of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J00291+5934 observed by XMM-Newton and NuSTAR during its 2015 outburst. The source is in a hard state dominated at high energies by a Comptonization of soft photons (∼0.9 keV) by an electron population with kT<SUB>e</SUB> ∼ 30 keV, and at lower energies by a blackbody component with kT ∼ 0.5 keV. A moderately broad, neutral Fe emission line and four narrow absorption lines are also found. By investigating the pulse phase evolution, we derived the best-fitting orbital solution for the 2015 outburst. Comparing the updated ephemeris with those of the previous outbursts, we set a 3σ confidence level interval -6.6 × 10<SUP>-13</SUP> s s<SUP>-1</SUP> &lt; dot P _ orb  &lt; 6.5 × 10^ -13  s s<SUP>-1</SUP> on the orbital period derivative. Moreover, we investigated the pulse profile dependence on energy finding a peculiar behaviour of the pulse fractional amplitude and lags as a function of energy. We performed a phase-resolved spectroscopy showing that the blackbody component tracks remarkably well the pulse profile, indicating that this component resides at the neutron star surface (hotspot).},

	abstract = {We have performed a timing analysis of all the four X-ray outbursts from the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 observed so far by the Proportional Counter Array on board the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. For each of the outbursts, we derived the best-fitting value of the time of ascending node passage. We find that these times follow a parabolic trend, which gives an orbital-period derivative , and a refined estimate of the orbital period, P<SUB>orb</SUB> = 7249.156499 +/- 1.8 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> s (reference epoch T<SUB>0</SUB> = 50914.8099 MJD). This derivative is positive, suggesting a degenerate or fully convective companion star, but is more than one order of magnitude higher than what is expected from secular evolution driven by angular momentum losses caused by gravitational radiation under the hypothesis of conservative mass transfer. Using simple considerations on the angular momentum of the system, we propose an explanation of this puzzling result assuming that during X-ray quiescence the source is ejecting matter (and angular momentum) from the inner Lagrangian point. We have also verified that this behaviour is in agreement with a possible secular evolution of the system under the hypothesis of highly non-conservative mass transfer. In this case, we find stringent constraints on the masses of the two components of the binary system and its inclination. The proposed orbital evolution indicates that in this kind of sources the neutron star is capable to efficiently ablate the companion star, suggesting that this kind of objects are part of the population of the so-called black widow pulsars, still visible in X-rays during transient mass-accretion episodes.},

	abstract = {We report on a timing of the eclipse arrival times of the low mass X-ray binary and X-ray pulsar 2A 1822-371 performed using all available observations of the Proportional Counter Array on board the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, XMM-Newton pn, and Chandra. These observations span the years from 1996 to 2008. Combining these eclipse arrival time measurements with those already available covering the period from 1977 to 1996, we obtain an orbital solution valid for more than thirty years. The time delays calculated with respect to a constant orbital period model show a clear parabolic trend, implying that the orbital period in this source constantly increases with time at a rate dot P_orb = 1.50(7) × 10<SUP>-10</SUP> s/s. This is 3 orders of magnitude larger than what is expected from conservative mass transfer driven by magnetic braking and gravitational radiation. From the conservation of the angular momentum of the system we find that to explain the high and positive value of the orbital period derivative the mass transfer rate must not be less than 3 times the Eddington limit for a neutron star, suggesting that the mass transfer has to be partially non-conservative. With the hypothesis that the neutron star accretes at the Eddington limit we find a consistent solution in which at least 70% of the transferred mass has to be expelled from the system.},

	abstract = {We present a timing analysis of the 2015 outburst of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658, using non-simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations. We estimate the pulsar spin frequency and update the system orbital solution. Combining the average spin frequency from the previous observed, we confirm the long-term spin-down at an average rate \dot ν  _ SD =1.5(2)× 10^ -15  Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We also discuss possible corrections to the spin-down rate accounting for mass accretion on to the compact object when the system is X-ray active. Finally, combining the updated ephemerides with those of the previous outbursts, we find a long-term orbital evolution compatible with a binary expansion at a mean rate \dot P _ orb =3.6(4)× 10^ -12  s s<SUP>-1</SUP>, in agreement with previously reported values. This fast evolution is incompatible with an evolution driven by angular momentum losses caused by gravitational radiation under the hypothesis of conservative mass transfer. We discuss the observed orbital expansion in terms of non-conservative mass transfer and gravitational quadrupole coupling mechanism. We find that the latter can explain, under certain conditions, small fluctuations (of the order of few seconds) of the orbital period around a global parabolic trend. At the same time, a non-conservative mass transfer is required to explain the observed fast orbital evolution, which likely reflects ejection of a large fraction of mass from the inner Lagrangian point caused by the irradiation of the donor by the magnetodipole rotator during quiescence (radio-ejection model). This strong outflow may power tidal dissipation in the companion star and be responsible of the gravitational quadrupole change oscillations.},

	abstract = {We report on Chandra X-ray and Gemini-North near-infrared K-band observations of the eclipsing accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar SWIFT J1749.4-2807 in quiescence. Using the Chandra observation we derive a source position of right ascension 17:49:31.73 and declination -28:08:05.08. The position is accurate to 0.6 arcsec (90 per cent confidence). We find one source at a magnitude K = 18.44 $\pm$ 0.03 with a position fully consistent with the accurate Chandra X-ray localization and a second source at K = 19.2 $\pm$ 0.1 that falls close to the edge of the error circle in the deep K-band images. The presence of a few weaker sources as suggested by previous H-band observations presented in the literature cannot be ruled out. There is marginal evidence that the brighter of the these two sources is variable. Follow-up spectroscopy of this potential counterpart will show if this source is the true counterpart to SWIFT J1749.4-2807. If so, baring the presence of complicating effects such as heating of the mass-donor star, it would allow for the mass of the neutron star to be measured through the measurement of periodic radial velocity variations.},

	abstract = {We present a timing analysis of the 2002 outburst of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. A study of the phase delays of the entire pulse profile shows a behavior that is surprising and difficult to interpret: superposed to a general trend, a big jump by about 0.2 in phase is visible, starting at day 14 after the beginning of the outburst. An analysis of the pulse profile indicates the presence of a significant first harmonic. Studying the fundamental and the first harmonic separately, we find that the phase delays of the first harmonic are more regular, with no sign of the jump observed in the fundamental. The fitting of the phase delays of the first harmonic with a model that takes into account the observed exponential decay of the X-ray flux (and therefore of the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star) gives important information on the torque acting on the neutron star during the outburst. We find that the source shows spin-up in the first part of the outburst, while a spin-down dominates at the end. From these results we derive an estimate of the neutron star magnetic field strength.},

	abstract = {We present observations of a series of 10 outbursts of pulsed hard X-ray flux from the transient 10.6 mHz accreting pulsar GS 1843-02, using the Burst and Transient Source Experiment on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. These outbursts occurred regularly every 242 days, coincident with the ephemeris of the periodic transient GRO J1849-03, which has recently been identified with the SAS 3 source 2S 1845-024. Our pulsed detection provides the first clear identification of GS 1843-02 with 2S 1845-024. We present a pulse timing analysis that shows that the 2S 1845-024 outbursts occur near the periastron passage of the neutron star's highly eccentric (e=0.88+/-0.01) 242.18+/-0.01 day period binary orbit about a high-mass (M<SUB>c</SUB>&gt;7 M<SUB>solar</SUB>) companion. The orbit and transient outburst pattern strongly suggest that the pulsar is in a binary system with a Be star. Our observations show a long-term spin-up trend, with most of the spin-up occurring during the outbursts. From the measured spin-up rates and inferred luminosities we conclude that an accretion disk is present during the outbursts.},

The system is an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar in a 75-minute ultracompact binary. The mass donor is most likely a ≃0.02 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> finite-entropy white dwarf composed of He or C/O. The fractional rms pulsed amplitude is 7.4%, and the soft (1-3 keV) X-ray pulse profile contains a significant second harmonic. The pulsed amplitude and pulse phase lag (relative to our mean timing model) are energy dependent, each having a local maximum at 4 and 1.5 keV, respectively. We also recovered the X-ray pulsations in archival 2012 XMM-Newton observations, allowing us to measure a long-term pulsar spin-down rate of $\dot \nu  =-2.1(7)\times  10 ^ -14 $ Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP> and to infer a pulsar surface dipole magnetic field strength of ≃10<SUP>9</SUP> G. We show that the mass transfer in the binary is likely nonconservative, and we discuss various scenarios for mass loss from the system.},

	abstract = {We discuss the spectral and timing properties of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SWIFT J1756.9-2508 observed by XMM-Newton, NICER, and NuSTAR during the X-ray outburst occurred in April 2018. The spectral properties of the source are consistent with a hard state dominated at high energies by a non-thermal power-law component with a cut-off at ∼70 keV. No evidence of iron emission lines or reflection humps has been found. From the coherent timing analysis of the pulse profiles, we derived an updated set of orbital ephemerides. Combining the parameters measured from the three outbursts shown by the source in the last ∼11 yr, we investigated the secular evolution of the spin frequency and the orbital period. We estimated a neutron magnetic field of 3.1× 10<SUP>8</SUP> &lt; B_  PC &lt; 4.5× 10<SUP>8</SUP> G and measured an orbital period derivative of -4.1× 10^ -12  &lt; \dot P _  orb &lt; 7.1× 10^ -12  s s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We also studied the energy dependence of the pulse profile by characterizing the behaviour of the pulse fractional amplitude in the energy range 0.3-80 keV. These results are compared with those obtained from the previous outbursts of SWIFT J1756.9-2508 and other previously known accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars.},

The coherent signal shows a clear Doppler modulation from which we estimate an orbital period of 1.9 h and a projected semi-major axis of 8 lt-ms. Taking into account the lack of eclipses (inclination angle of &lt;75$\,^{\circ}$) and assuming a neutron star mass of 1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, we have estimated a minimum companion star of 0.06 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Considerations on the probability distribution of the binary inclination angle make the hypothesis of a main-sequence companion star less likely. On the other hand, the close correspondence with the orbital parameters of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 suggests the presence of a bloated brown dwarf. The energy spectrum of the source is well described by a soft disk black-body component (kT 0.45 keV) plus a Comptonisation spectrum with photon index 1.9. No sign of emission lines or reflection components are significantly detected.

	abstract = {The accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1807-294 was observed as a Target of Opportunity (ToO) by XMM-Newton on March 22, 2003 after its discovery on February 21, 2003 by RXTE. The source was detected in its bright phase with an observed average count rate of 33.3 cts s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the EPIC-pn camera in the 0.5-10 keV energy band (3.7 mCrab). Using the earlier established best-fit orbital period of 40.0741 $\pm$ 0.0005 min from the RXTE observations and considering a circular binary orbit as first approximation, we derived a value of 4.8 $\pm$ 0.1 lt-ms for the projected orbital radius of the binary system and an epoch of the orbital phase of MJD 52 720.67415(16). The barycentric mean spin period of the pulsar was derived as 5.2459427 $\pm$ 0.0000004 ms. The pulsar's spin-pulse profile showed a prominent (1.5 ms FWHM) pulse, with energy and orbital phase dependence in the amplitude and shape. The measured pulsed fraction in four energy bands was found to be 3.1 $\pm$ 0.2% (0.5-3.0 keV), 5.4 $\pm$ 0.4% (3.0-6.0 keV), 5.1 $\pm$ 0.7% (6.0-10.0 keV) and 3.7 $\pm$ 0.2% (0.5-10.0 keV), respectively. Studies of spin-profiles with orbital phase and energy showed significant increase in its pulsed fraction during the second observed orbit of the neutron star, gradually declining in the subsequent two orbits, which was associated with sudden but marginal increase in mass accretion. From our investigations of orbital parameters and estimation of other properties of this compact binary system, we conclude that XTE J1807-294 is very likely a candidate for a millisecond radio pulsar.},

To date, this is the tightest constraint on the orbital inclination of any AMXP. As in other AMXPs, the pulse profile shows harmonic content up to the third overtone. However, this is the first AMXP to show a first overtone with rms amplitudes between ~6% and ~23%, which is the strongest ever seen and which can be more than two times stronger than the fundamental. The fact that SWIFT J1749.4-2807 is an eclipsing system that shows uncommonly strong harmonic content suggests that it might be the best source to date to set constraints on neutron star properties including compactness and geometry.},

We derived, by phase-connected timing analysis of the observed pulses, an updated set of the source ephemeris. We were also able to investigate the spin-up of the X-ray pulsar as a consequence of the accretion torque during the outburst. Relating the spin-up rate and the mass accretion rate as \dot ν  ∝ \dot M ^ β  , we fitted the pulse phase delays obtaining a value of β = 0.96(3). Combining the results from the source spin-up frequency derivative and the flux estimation, we constrained the source distance to be between 3.4 and 4.1 kpc, assuming a disc viscous parameter α to be in the range of 0.1-1. Finally, we investigated the presence of a possible spin-down torque by adding a quadratic component to the pulse phase delay model. The marginal statistical improvement of the updated model does not allow us to firmly confirm the presence of this component.},

	abstract = {We report on the timing analysis of the 2015 outburst of the intermittent accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021 observed on March 4 by the X-ray satellite XMM-Newton. By phase connecting the time of arrivals of the observed pulses, we derived the best-fitting orbital solution for the 2015 outburst. We investigated the energy pulse profile dependence finding that the pulse fractional amplitude increases with energy while no significant time lags are detected. Moreover, we investigated the previous outbursts from this source, finding previously undetected pulsations in some intervals during the 2010 outburst of the source. Comparing the updated set of orbital parameters, in particular the value of the time of passage from the ascending node, with the orbital solutions reported from the previous outbursts, we estimated for the first time the orbital period derivative corresponding with dot P _ orb =(1.1$\pm$ 0.3)× 10^ -10  s s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We note that this value is significant at 3.5σ confidence level, because of significant fluctuations with respect to the parabolic trend and more observations are needed in order to confirm the finding. Assuming the reliability of the result, we suggest that the large value of the orbital-period derivative can be explained as a result of a highly non-conservative mass transfer driven by emission of gravitational waves, which implies the ejection of matter from a region close to the inner Lagrangian point. We also discuss possible alternative explanations.},

	abstract = {We present the first Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow catalog. The catalog contains data from over 64,000 independent UVOT image observations of 229 GRBs first detected by Swift, the High Energy Transient Explorer 2 (HETE2), the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), and the Interplanetary Network (IPN). The catalog covers GRBs occurring during the period from 2005 January 17 to 2007 June 16 and includes ~86% of the bursts detected by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). The catalog provides detailed burst positional, temporal, and photometric information extracted from each of the UVOT images. Positions for bursts detected at the 3σ level are provided with a nominal accuracy, relative to the USNO-B1 catalog, of ~0farcs25. Photometry for each burst is given in three UV bands, three optical bands, and a "white" or open filter. Upper limits for magnitudes are reported for sources detected below 3σ. General properties of the burst sample and light curves, including the filter-dependent temporal slopes, are also provided. The majority of the UVOT light curves, for bursts detected at the 3σ level, can be fit by a single power-law, with a median temporal slope (α) of 0.96, beginning several hundred seconds after the burst trigger and ending at ~1 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> s. The median UVOT v-band (~5500 {\AA}) magnitude at 2000 s for a sample of "well"-detected bursts is 18.02. The UVOT flux interpolated to 2000 s after the burst, shows relatively strong correlations with both the prompt Swift BAT fluence, and the Swift X-ray flux at 11 hr after the trigger.},

	abstract = {We present a 7 yr timing study of the 2.5 ms X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658, an X-ray transient with a recurrence time of ≈2 yr, using data from the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer covering four transient outbursts (1998-2005). We verify that the 401 Hz pulsation traces the spin frequency fundamental and not a harmonic. Substantial pulse shape variability, both stochastic and systematic, was observed during each outburst. Analysis of the systematic pulse shape changes suggests that, as an outburst dims, the X-ray "hot spot" on the pulsar surface drifts longitudinally and a second hot spot may appear. The overall pulse shape variability limits the ability to measure spin frequency evolution within a given X-ray outburst (and calls previous dot nu measurements of this source into question), with typical upper limits of |dot nu| &lt;~ 2.5 × 10<SUP>-14</SUP> Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP> (2 σ). However, combining data from all the outbursts shows with high (6 σ) significance that the pulsar is undergoing long-term spin down at a rate dot nu = (-5.6 +/- 2.0) × 10<SUP>-16</SUP> Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP>, with most of the spin evolution occurring during X-ray quiescence. We discuss the possible contributions of magnetic propeller torques, magnetic dipole radiation, and gravitational radiation to the measured spin down, setting an upper limit of B &lt; 1.5 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> G for the pulsar's surface dipole magnetic field and Q/I &lt; 5 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP> for the fractional mass quadrupole moment. We also measured an orbital period derivative of dot P<SUB>orb</SUB> = (3.5 +/- 0.2) × 10<SUP>-12</SUP> s s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This surprisingly large dot P<SUB>orb</SUB> is reminiscent of the large and quasi-cyclic orbital period variation observed in the so-called black widow millisecond radio pulsars, which further strengthens previous speculation that SAX J1808.4-3658 may turn on as a radio pulsar during quiescence. In an appendix we derive an improved (0.15'') source position from optical data.},

	abstract = {Soft phase lags, in which X-ray pulses in lower energy bands arrive later than pulses in higher energy bands, have been observed in nearly all accretion-powered millisecond pulsars, but their origin remains an open question. In a study of the 2.5 ms accretion-powered pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658, we report that the magnitude of these lags is strongly dependent on the accretion rate. During the brightest stage of the outbursts from this source, the lags increase in magnitude as the accretion rate drops; when the outbursts enter their dimmer flaring-tail stage, the relationship reverses. We evaluate this complex dependence in the context of two theoretical models for the lags, one relying on the scattering of photons by the accretion disk and the other invoking a two-component model for the photon emission. In both cases, the turnover suggests that we are observing the source transitioning into the "propeller" accretion regime.},

	abstract = {The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer has observed five outbursts from the transient 2.5 ms accretion-powered pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 during 1998-2008. We present a pulse timing study of the most recent outburst and compare it with the previous timing solutions. The spin frequency of the source continues to decrease at a rate of (-5.5 $\pm$ 1.2) × 10<SUP>-18</SUP> Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is consistent with the previously determined spin derivative. The spin down occurs mostly during quiescence, and is most likely due to the magnetic dipole torque from a B = 1.5 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> G dipolar field at the neutron star surface. We also find that the 2 hr binary orbital period is increasing at a rate of (3.80 $\pm$ 0.06) × 10<SUP>-12</SUP> s s<SUP>-1</SUP>, also consistent with previous measurements. It remains uncertain whether this orbital change reflects secular evolution or short-term variability.},

Using observations collected with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), we establish the pulsar spin frequency and orbital phase during its latest epoch. We find that the 2019 outburst shows a pronounced evolution in pulse phase over the course of the outburst. These phase shifts are found to correlate with the source flux and are interpreted in terms of hot-spot drift on the stellar surface, driven by changes in the mass accretion rate. Additionally, we find that the long-term evolution of the pulsar spin frequency shows evidence for a modulation at the Earth's orbital period, allowing for pulsar timing based astrometry of this accreting millisecond pulsar.},

	abstract = {We present a systematic study of the orbital inclination effects on black hole transients fast time-variability properties. We have considered all the black hole binaries that have been densely monitored by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite. We find that the amplitude of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) depends on the orbital inclination. type-C QPOs are stronger for nearly edge-on systems (high inclination), while type-B QPOs are stronger when the accretion disc is closer to face-on (low inclination). Our results also suggest that the noise associated with type-C QPOs is consistent with being stronger for low-inclination sources, while the noise associated with type-B QPOs seems inclination independent. These results are consistent with a geometric origin of the type-C QPOs - for instance arising from relativistic precession of the inner flow within a truncated disc - while the noise would correspond to intrinsic brightness variability from mass accretion rate fluctuations in the accretion flow. The opposite behaviour of type-B QPOs - stronger in low-inclinations sources - supports the hypothesis that type-B QPOs are related to the jet, the power of which is the most obvious measurable parameter expected to be stronger in nearly face-on sources.},

Coherent X-ray pulsations around 527.4 Hz (1.9 ms) with a clear Doppler modulation were detected. This implies an orbital period of ∼8.8 h and a projected semi-major axis of ∼1.23 lt-s. With the binary mass function, we estimate a minimum companion mass of 0.42 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, obtained assuming a neutron star mass of 1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and an inclination angle lower than 60$\,^{\circ}$, as suggested by the absence of eclipses or dips in the light curve of the source. The broad-band energy spectrum, obtained by combining NuSTAR, swift and INTEGRAL observations, is dominated by Comptonisation of soft thermal seed photons with a temperature of ∼0.7 keV by electrons heated to 21 keV. We also detect black-body-like thermal direct emission that is compatible with an emission region of a few kilometers and a temperature compatible with the seed source of Comptonisation. A weak Gaussian line centred on the iron Kα complex can be interpreted as a signature of disc reflection. A similar spectrum characterises the NICER spectra, which was measured when the outburst faded.},

We obtain an updated orbital solution of the binary system. We investigate the evolution of the neutron star spin frequency during the outburst, reporting a refined estimate of the spin frequency and the first estimate of the spin frequency derivative ( $\dot \nu  \sim -7\times 10^ -14 $ Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP>), confirmed independently from the modelling of the fundamental frequency and its first harmonic. We further investigate the evolution of the X-ray pulse phases adopting a physical model that accounts for the accretion material torque as well as the magnetic threading of the accretion disc in regions where the Keplerian velocity is slower than the magnetosphere velocity. From this analysis we estimate the neutron star magnetic field B<SUB>eq</SUB> = 2.8(3) × 10<SUP>8</SUP> G. Finally, we investigate the pulse profile dependence on energy finding that the observed behaviour of the pulse fractional amplitude and lags as a function of energy is compatible with the down-scattering of hard X-ray photons in the disc or the neutron star surface.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of X-ray eclipses in the recently discovered accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SWIFT J1749.4-2807. This is the first detection of X-ray eclipses in a system of this type and should enable a precise neutron star mass measurement once the companion star is identified and studied. We present a combined pulse and eclipse timing solution that enables tight constraints on the orbital parameters and inclination and shows that the companion mass is in the range 0.6-0.8 M <SUB>sun</SUB> for a likely range of neutron star masses, and that it is larger than a main-sequence star of the same mass. We observed two individual eclipse egresses and a single ingress. Our timing model shows that the eclipse features are symmetric about the time of 90$\,^{\circ}$ longitude from the ascending node, as expected. Our eclipse timing solution gives an eclipse duration (from the mid-points of ingress to egress) of 2172 $\pm$ 13 s. This represents 6.85% of the 8.82 hr orbital period. This system also presents a potential measurement of "Shapiro" delay due to general relativity; through this technique alone, we set an upper limit to the companion mass of 2.2 M <SUB>sun</SUB>.},

	abstract = {In this work, we report on observations with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer of the known neutron star X-ray transient XTE J1739-285. We observed the source in 2020 February and March, finding it in a highly active bursting state. Across a 20 day period, we detected 32 thermonuclear X-ray bursts, with an average burst recurrence time of $ 2.0 _ -0.3 ^ +0.4 \,\mathrm hr $ . A timing and spectral analysis of the ensemble of X-ray bursts reveals homogeneous burst properties, evidence for short-recurrence time bursts, and the detection of a 386.5 Hz burst oscillation candidate. The latter is especially notable, given that a previous study of this source claimed a 1122 Hz burst oscillation candidate. We did not find any evidence of variability near 1122 Hz and instead find that the 386.5 Hz oscillation is the more prominent signal of the two burst oscillation candidates. Hence, we conclude it is unlikely that XTE J1739-285 has a submillisecond rotation period.},

We further find that the $0.4-6$ keV pulse fraction varies gradually between 0.5% and 2.5% following a sinusoidal oscillation with a $1210\pm40$ day period. Finally, we supplemented this analysis with an archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observation, and obtained a phase coherent model for the binary orbit spanning 12 years, yielding an orbital period derivative measurement of $(8.4\pm2.0) \times 10^{-12}$ s/s. This large orbital period derivative is inconsistent with a binary evolution that is dominated by gravitational wave emission, and is suggestive of highly non-conservative mass transfer in the binary system.},

	abstract = {We present a systematic analysis of the complete set of observations of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U1608-52 obtained by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer's Proportional Counter Array. We study the spectral and fast time variability properties of the source in order to determine the mass and spin of the neutron star via the relativistic precession model, and find 24 observations containing usable sets of the necessary three quasi-periodic oscillations (triplets) with which to accomplish this task, along with a further 7 observations containing two of the three quasi-periodic oscillations each. We calculate the spin and mass of the source for each of the triplets, and find that they give physically realistic estimates clustering in the spin range 0.19 < a < 0.35 and mass range 2.15 < M/M&sun; < 2.6. Neutron stars present environments for studying matter under the most extreme conditions of pressure and density; as their equation of state is not yet known, accurate measurements of their mass and spin will eventually allow for the discrimination between various models. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of equation of state predictions, physically allowed spin ranges, emission proximity to the innermost stable circular orbit, and possible model inaccuracies.},

The primary objective of GBM is to extend the energy range over which bursts are observed downward from the energy range of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on Fermi into the hard X-ray range where extensive previous data sets exist. A secondary objective is to compute burst locations onboard to allow re-orienting the spacecraft so that the LAT can observe delayed emission from bright bursts. GBM uses an array of 12 sodium iodide scintillators and two bismuth germanate scintillators to detect gamma rays from ~8 keV to ~40 MeV over the full unocculted sky. The onboard trigger threshold is ~0.7 photons cm-2 s-1 (50-300 keV, 1 s peak). GBM generates onboard triggers for ~250 GRBs per year.},

	abstract = {Aims: A theoretical framework is developed to estimate the optimal binning of X-ray spectra.  Methods: We derived expressions for the optimal bin size for model spectra as well as for observed data using different levels of sophistication.  Results: It is shown that by taking into account both the number of photons in a given spectral model bin and their average energy over the bin size, the number of model energy bins and the size of the response matrix can be reduced by a factor of 10-100. The response matrix should then contain the response at the bin centre as well as its derivative with respect to the incoming photon energy. We provide practical guidelines for how to construct optimal energy grids as well as how to structure the response matrix. A few examples are presented to illustrate the present methods.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary status of the low-mass X-ray binary SAX J1808.4 - 3658 is simulated by following the binary evolution of its possible progenitor system through mass transfer, starting at a period of ˜6.6 h. The evolution includes angular momentum losses via magnetic braking and gravitational radiation. It also takes into account the effects of illumination of the donor by both the X-ray emission and the spin down luminosity of the pulsar. The system goes through stages of mass transfer and stages during which it is detached, where only the rotationally powered pulsar irradiates the donor. We show that the pulsar irradiation is a necessary ingredient to reach SAX J1808.4 - 3658 orbital period when the donor mass is reduced to 0.04-0.06 M&sun;. We also show that the models reproduce important properties of the system, including the orbital period derivative, which is shown to be directly linked to the evolution through mass transfer cycles. Moreover, we find that the effects of the irradiation on the internal structure of the donor are non-negligible, causing the companion star to be non-completely convective at the values of mass observed for the system and significantly altering its long term evolution, as the magnetic braking remains active along the whole evolution.},

@article{Romano:2006aa,
	abstract = {We present observations of GRB 060124, the first event for which both the prompt and the afterglow emission could be observed simultaneously and in their entirety by the three Swift instruments. Indeed, Swift-BAT triggered on a precursor ~570 s before the main burst peak, and this allowed Swift to repoint the narrow field instruments to the burst position ~350 s before the main burst occurred. GRB 060124 also triggered Konus-Wind, which observed the prompt emission in a harder gamma-ray band (up to 2 MeV). Thanks to these exceptional circumstances, the temporal and spectral properties of the prompt emission can be studied in the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray ranges. While the X-ray emission (0.2-10 keV) clearly tracks the gamma-ray burst, the optical component follows a different pattern, likely indicating a different origin, possibly the onset of external shocks. The prompt GRB spectrum shows significant spectral evolution, with both the peak energy and the spectral index varying. As observed in several long GRBs, significant lags are measured between the hard- and low-energy components, showing that this behaviour extends over 3 decades in energy. The GRB peaks are also much broader at soft energies. This is related to the temporal evolution of the spectrum, and can be accounted for by assuming that the electron spectral index softened with time. The burst energy (E_iso ˜ 5 × 1053 erg) and average peak energy (Ep ˜ 300 keV) make GRB 060124 consistent with the Amati relation. The X-ray afterglow is characterized by a decay which presents a break at tb ˜ 105 s.},

	abstract = {We report on quasi-simultaneous observations from radio to X-ray frequencies of the neutron star X-ray binary Aql X-1 over accretion state transitions during its 2016 outburst. All the observations show radio to millimetre spectra consistent with emission from a jet, with a spectral break from optically thick to optically thin synchrotron emission that decreases from  100 GHz to <5.5 GHz during the transition from a hard to a soft accretion state. The 5.5 GHz radio flux density as the source reaches the soft state, 0.82 $\pm$ 0.03 mJy, is the highest recorded to date for this source. During the decay of the outburst, the jet spectral break is detected again at a frequency of  30-100 GHz. The flux density is 0.75 $\pm$ 0.03 mJy at 97.5 GHz at this stage. This is the first time that a change in the frequency of the jet break of a neutron star X-ray binary has been measured, indicating that the processes at play in black holes are also present in neutron stars, supporting the idea that the internal properties of the jet rely most critically on the conditions of the accretion disc and corona around the compact object, rather than the black hole mass or spin or the neutron star surface or magnetic field.},

	abstract = {The ESA observatory INTEGRAL (International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory) is dedicated to the fine spectroscopy (2.5 keV FWHM @ 1 MeV) and fine imaging (angular resolution: 12 arcmin FWHM) of celestial gamma-ray sources in the energy range 15 keV to 10 MeV with concurrent source monitoring in the X-ray (3-35 keV) and optical (V-band, 550 nm) energy ranges. INTEGRAL carries two main gamma-ray instruments, the spectrometer SPI (Vedrenne et al. \cite{vedrenne}) - optimized for the high-resolution gamma-ray line spectroscopy (20 keV-8 MeV), and the imager IBIS (Ubertini et al. \cite{ubertini}) - optimized for high-angular resolution imaging (15 keV-10 MeV). Two monitors, JEM-X (Lund et al. \cite{lund}) in the (3-35) keV X-ray band, and OMC (Mas-Hesse et al. \cite{mas}) in optical Johnson V-band complement the payload. The ground segment includes the Mission Operations Centre at ESOC, ESA and NASA ground stations, the Science Operations Centre at ESTEC and the Science Data Centre near Geneva. INTEGRAL was launched on 17 October 2002. The observing programme is well underway and sky exposure (until June 2003) reaches  ~ 1800 ks in the Galactic plane. The prospects are excellent for the scientific community to observe the high energy sky using state-of-the-art gamma-ray imaging and spectroscopy. This paper presents a high-level overview of INTEGRAL.},

	abstract = {SAX J1748.9-2021 is an accreting X-ray millisecond pulsar observed in outburst five times since its discovery in 1998. In early October 2017, the source started its sixth outburst, which lasted only ˜13 days, significantly shorter than the typical 30 days duration of the previous outbursts. It reached a 0.3-70 keV unabsorbed peak luminosity of ˜3 × 1036 erg s-1. This is the weakest outburst ever reported for this source to date. We analysed almost simultaneous XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and INTEGRAL observations taken during the decaying phase of its 2017 outburst. We found that the spectral properties of SAX J1748.9-2021 are consistent with an absorbed Comptonization plus a blackbody component. The former, characterized by an electron temperature of ˜20 keV, a photon index of ˜1.6-1.7 keV, and seed photon temperature of 0.44 keV, can be associated to a hot corona or the accretion column, while the latter is more likely originating from the neutron star surface (kTbb ˜ 0.6 keV, Rbb ˜ 2.5 km). These findings suggest that SAX J1748.9-2021 was observed in a hard spectral state, as it is typically the case for accreting millisecond pulsars in outburst.},

@article{Campana2018a,
	abstract = {In the last 20 years our understanding of the millisecond pulsar (MSP) population changed dramatically. Thanks to RXTE, we discovered that neutron stars in LMXBs spins at 200-750 Hz frequencies, and indirectly confirmed the recycling scenario, according to which neutron stars are spun up to ms periods during the LMXB-phase. In the meantime, the continuous discovery of rotation-powered MSPs in binary systems in the radio and gamma-ray band (mainly with the Fermi LAT) allowed us to classify these sources into two "spiders" populations, depending on the mass of their companion stars: Black Widow, with very low-mass companion stars, and Redbacks, with larger companions possibly filling their Roche lobes but without accretion. It was soon regained that MSPs in short orbital period LMXBs are the progenitors of the spider populations of rotation-powered MSPs, although a direct link between accretion- and rotation-powered MSPs was still missing. In 2013 XMM-Newton spotted the X-ray outburst of a new accreting MSP (IGR J18245-2452) in a source that was previously classified as a radio MSP. Follow up observations of the source when it went back to X-ray quiescence showed that it was able to swing between accretion- to rotation-powered pulsations in a relatively short timescale (few days), promoting this source as the direct link between the LMXB and the radio MSP phases. Following discoveries showed that there exists a bunch of sources, which alternates X-ray activity phases, showing X-ray pulsations, to radio-loud phases, showing radio pulsations, establishing a new class of MSPs: the Transitional MSP. In this review we describe these exciting discoveries and the properties of accreting and transitional MSPs, highlighting what we know and what we have still to learn about in order to fully understand the (sometime puzzling) behavior of these systems and their evolutive connection (abridged).},

	abstract = {GRO J1744-28 (the Bursting Pulsar) is a neutron star low-mass X-ray binary which shows highly structured X-ray variability near the end of its X-ray outbursts. In this letter we show that this variability is analogous to that seen in Transitional Millisecond Pulsars such as PSR J1023+0038: `missing link' systems consisting of a pulsar nearing the end of its recycling phase. As such, we show that the Bursting Pulsar may also be associated with this class of objects. We discuss the implications of this scenario; in particular, we discuss the fact that the Bursting Pulsar has a significantly higher spin period and magnetic field than any other known transitional pulsar. If the Bursting Pulsar is indeed transitional, then this source opens a new window of opportunity to test our understanding of these systems in an entirely unexplored physical regime.},

	abstract = {We describe a new and efficient technique, which we call sideband or phase-modulation searching, that allows one to detect short-period binary pulsars in observations longer than the orbital period. The orbital motion of the pulsar during long observations effectively modulates the phase of the pulsar signal, causing sidebands to appear around the pulsar spin frequency and its harmonics in the Fourier transform. For the majority of binary radio pulsars or low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), large numbers of sidebands are present, allowing efficient searches using Fourier transforms of short portions of the original power spectrum. Analysis of the complex amplitudes and phases of the sidebands can provide enough information to solve for the Keplerian orbital parameters. This technique is particularly applicable to radio pulsar searches in globular clusters and searches for coherent X-ray pulsations from LMXBs and is complementary to more standard ``acceleration'' searches.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive X-ray study of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary IGR J17062-6143, which has been accreting at low luminosities since its discovery in 2006. Analysing NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Swift observations, we investigate the very faint nature of this source through three approaches: modelling the relativistic reflection spectrum to constrain the accretion geometry, performing high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to search for an outflow, and searching for the recently reported millisecond X-ray pulsations. We find a strongly truncated accretion disc at 77^{+22}_{-18} gravitational radii (˜164 km) assuming a high inclination, although a low inclination and a disc extending to the neutron star cannot be excluded. The high-resolution spectroscopy reveals evidence for oxygen-rich circumbinary material, possibly resulting from a blueshifted, collisionally ionized outflow. Finally, we do not detect any pulsations. We discuss these results in the broader context of possible explanations for the persistent faint nature of weakly accreting neutron stars. The results are consistent with both an ultra-compact binary orbit and a magnetically truncated accretion flow, although both cannot be unambiguously inferred. We also discuss the nature of the donor star and conclude that it is likely a CO or O-Ne-Mg white dwarf, consistent with recent multiwavelength modelling.},

	abstract = {We present Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Serpens X-1 during the early mission phase in 2017. With the high spectral sensitivity and low-energy X-ray passband of NICER, we are able to detect the Fe L line complex in addition to the signature broad, asymmetric Fe K line. We confirm the presence of these lines by comparing the NICER data to archival observations with XMM-Newton/RGS and NuSTAR. Both features originate close to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). When modeling the lines with the relativistic line model RELLINE, we find the Fe L blend requires an inner disk radius of $1.4_{-0.1}^{+0.2}$ $R_{\mathrm{ISCO}}$ and Fe K is at $1.03_{-0.03}^{+0.13}$ $R_{\mathrm{ISCO}}$ (errors quoted at 90%). This corresponds to a position of $17.3_{-1.2}^{+2.5}$ km and $12.7_{-0.4}^{+1.6}$ km for a canonical neutron star mass ($M_{\mathrm{NS}}=1.4\ M_{\odot}$) and dimensionless spin value of $a=0$. Additionally, we employ a new version of the RELXILL model tailored for neutron stars and determine that these features arise from a dense disk and supersolar Fe abundance.},

	abstract = {Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) switch, on roughly multi-year timescales, between rotation-powered radio millisecond pulsar (RMSP) and accretion-powered low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) states. The tMSPs have raised several questions related to the nature of accretion flow in their LMXB state and the mechanism that causes the state switch. The discovery of coherent X-ray pulsations from PSR J1023+0038 (while in the LMXB state) provides us with the first opportunity to perform timing observations and to compare the neutron star's spin variation during this state to the measured spin-down in the RMSP state. Whereas the X-ray pulsations in the LMXB state likely indicate that some material is accreting onto the neutron star's magnetic polar caps, radio continuum observations indicate the presence of an outflow. The fraction of the inflowing material being ejected is not clear, but it may be much larger than that reaching the neutron star's surface. Timing observations can measure the total torque on the neutron star. We have phase-connected nine XMM-Newton observations of PSR J1023+0038 over the last 2.5 years of the LMXB state to establish a precise measurement of spin evolution. We find that the average spin-down rate as an LMXB is 26.8 $\pm$ 0.4% faster than the rate (-2.39 × 10-15 Hz s-1) determined during the RMSP state. This shows that negative angular momentum contributions (dipolar magnetic braking, and outflow) exceed positive ones (accreted material), and suggests that the pulsar wind continues to operate at a largely unmodified level. We discuss implications of this tight observational constraint in the context of possible accretion models.},

	abstract = {We perform a reflection study on a new observation of the neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary Aquila X-1 taken with NuSTAR during the 2016 August outburst and compare with the 2014 July outburst. The source was captured at ˜32% L Edd, which is over four times more luminous than the previous observation during the 2014 outburst. Both observations exhibit a broadened Fe line profile. Through reflection modeling, we determine that the inner disk is truncated {R}{in,2016}={11}-1+2 {R}g (where R  g  = GM/c 2) and {R}{in,2014}=14+/- 2 {R}g (errors quoted at the 90% confidence level). Fiducial NS parameters (M NS = 1.4 M &sun;, R NS = 10 km) give a stellar radius of R NS = 4.85 R  g ; our measurements rule out a disk extending to that radius at more than the 6sigma level of confidence. We are able to place an upper limit on the magnetic field strength of B <= 3.0-4.5 × 109 G at the magnetic poles, assuming that the disk is truncated at the magnetospheric radius in each case. This is consistent with previous estimates of the magnetic field strength for Aquila X-1. However, if the magnetosphere is not responsible for truncating the disk prior to the NS surface, we estimate a boundary layer with a maximum extent of {R}{BL,2016}˜ 10 {R}g and {R}{BL,2014}˜ 6 {R}g. Additionally, we compare the magnetic field strength inferred from the Fe line profile of Aquila X-1 and other NS low-mass X-ray binaries to known accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars.},

	abstract = {We analysed the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data from a sample of bright accreting neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). With the aim of studying the quasi-periodic variability as a function of the accretion regime, we carried out a systematic search of the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the X-ray time series of these systems, using the integrated fractional variability as a tracker for the accretion states. We found that the three QPO types originally identified in the 1980s for the brightest LMXBs, the so-called Z sources, I.e. horizontal, normal and flaring branch oscillations (HBOs, NBOs and FBOs, respectively), are also identified in the slightly less bright NS LMXBs, the so-called atoll sources, where we see QPOs with a behaviour consistent with the HBOs and FBOs. We compared the quasi-periodic variability properties of our NS sample with those of a sample of black hole (BH) LMXBs. We confirm the association between HBOs, NBOs and FBOs observed in Z sources, with the type-C, type-B and type-A QPOs, respectively, observed in BH systems, and we extended the comparison to the HBO-like and FBO-like QPOs seen in atoll sources. We conclude that the variability properties of BH and weakly magnetized NS LMXBs show strong similarities, with QPOs only weakly sensitive to the nature of the central compact object in both classes of systems. We find that the historical association between kHz QPOs and high-frequency QPOs, seen around NSs and BHs, respectively, is not obvious when comparing similar accretion states in the two kinds of systems.},

	abstract = {We have systematically studied a large sample of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) monitored by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (50 sources; 10000+ observations). We find that the hysteresis patterns between Compton-dominated and thermal-dominated states, typically observed in black hole LMXBs, are also common in neutron star systems. These patterns, which also sample intermediate states, are found when looking at the evolution of both X-ray colour and fast variability of 10 systems accreting below ˜30 per cent of the Eddington luminosity (LEdd). We show that hysteresis does not require large changes in luminosity and it is the natural form that state transitions take at these luminosities. At higher accretion rates, neutron stars do not show hysteresis, and they remain in a thermal-dominated, low-variability state, characterized by flaring behaviour and fast colour changes. Only at luminosities close to LEdd, are high variability levels seen again, in correspondence to an increase in the fractional contribution of the Comptonization component. We compare this behaviour with that observed in LMXBs harbouring black holes, showing that the spectral, timing and multiwavelength properties of a given source can be determined by its location in the fast variability-luminosity diagram, which, therefore, provides a common framework for neutron star and black hole accretion states.},

	abstract = {Due to observational challenges, our knowledge of low-level accretion flows around neutron stars is limited. We present NuSTAR, Swift and Chandra observations of the low-mass X-ray binary IGR J17062-6143, which has been persistently accreting at ~=0.1 per cent of the Eddington limit since 2006. Our simultaneous NuSTAR/Swift observations show that the 0.5-79 keV spectrum can be described by a combination of a power law with a photon index of Gamma ~= 2, a blackbody with a temperature of kTbb ~= 0.5 keV (presumably arising from the neutron star surface) and disc reflection. Modelling the reflection spectrum suggests that the inner accretion disc was located at Rin ≳ 100 GM/c2 (≳225 km) from the neutron star. The apparent truncation may be due to evaporation of the inner disc into a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow, or due to the pressure of the neutron star magnetic field. Our Chandra gratings data reveal possible narrow emission lines near 1 keV that can be modelled as reflection or collisionally ionized gas, and possible low-energy absorption features that could point to the presence of an outflow. We consider a scenario in which this neutron star has been able to sustain its low accretion rate through magnetic inhibition of the accretion flow, which gives some constraints on its magnetic field strength and spin period. In this configuration, IGR J17062-6143 could exhibit a strong radio jet as well as a (propeller-driven) wind-like outflow.},

The in-orbit performance and preliminary calibrations of the observatory are briefly summarised. The observations from the XMM-Newton calibration and performance verification phase, which are public and from which most papers in this issue have been derived, are listed. The flow of data from the spacecraft, through the ground segment, to the production of preliminary science products supplied to users is also discussed.

The mission contains three experiments: a set of large area xenon proportional counters sensitive from 2 - 60 keV (proportional counter array: PCA), a set of large area sodium iodide scintillators sensitive from 15 - 200 keV (high energy x-ray timing experiment: HEXTE), and three wide field of view scanning detectors which monitor most of the sky each orbit (all sky monitor: ASM). The goals of the mission are summarized by Swank et al. We present performance and calibration data on the measured and predicted in-orbit background, energy response, relative and absolute timing performance, and the operational possibilities made available with the high performance experiment data system (EDS) designed and built by MIT.},

	abstract = {The recurrent soft X-ray transient Aquila X-1 was observed with Suzaku for a gross duration of 79.9 ks, on 2011 October 21 when the object was in a rising phase of an outburst. During the observation, the source exhibited a clear spectral transition from the hard state to the soft state, on a time scale of ~30 ks. Across the transition, the 0.8-10 keV X-Ray Imaging Spectrometer count rate increased by a factor ~3, that of Hard X-ray Detector PIN (HXD-PIN) in 15-60 keV decreased by a similar factor, and the unabsorbed 0.1-100 keV luminosity increased from 3.5 × 1037 erg s-1 to 5.1 × 1037 erg s-1. The broadband spectral shape changed continuously, from a power-law-like one with a high-energy cut-off to a more convex one. Throughout the transition, the 0.8-60 keV spectra were successfully described with a model consisting of a multi-color blackbody and a Comptonized blackbody, which are considered to arise from a standard accretion disk and a closer vicinity of the neutron star, respectively. All the model parameters were confirmed to change continuously, from those typical in the hard state to those typical of the soft state. More specifically, the inner disk radius decreased from 31 km to 18 km, the effects of Comptonization on the blackbody photons weakened, and the electron temperature of Comptonization decreased from 10 keV to 3 keV. The derived parameters imply that the Comptonizing corona shrinks towards the final soft state, and/or the radial infall velocity of the corona decreases. These results reinforce the view that the soft and hard states of Aql X-1 (and of similar objects) are described by the same ``disk plus Comptonized blackbody'' model, but with considerably different parameters.},

	abstract = {As we observe in the moon-earth system, tidal interactions in binary systems can lead to angular momentum exchange. The presence of viscosity is generally regarded as the condition for such transfer to happen. In this paper, we show how the orbital evolution can cause a persistent torque between the binary components, even for inviscid bodies. This preferentially occurs at the final stage of coalescence of compact binaries, when the orbit shrinks successively by gravitational waves and plunging on a time-scale shorter than the viscous time-scale. The total orbital energy transferred to the secondary by this torque is ˜10-2 of its binding energy. We further show that this persistent torque induces a differentially rotating quadrupolar perturbation. Specializing to the case of a secondary neutron star, we find that this non-equilibrium state has an associated free energy of 1047-1048 erg, just prior to coalescence. This energy is likely stored in internal fluid motions, with a sizeable amount of differential rotation. By tapping this free energy reservoir, a pre-existing weak magnetic field could be amplified up to a strength of ≈1015 G. Such a dynamically driven tidal torque can thus recycle an old neutron star into a magnetar, with possible observational consequences at merger.},

Observation tests are also discussed. It is pointed out that RSCVn binary systems are particularly useful systems for testing the predictions of tidal theory.

Ballistic simulations suggest that these winds leave only from selected areas of the illuminated surface of the companion; surface currents channel into these regions relatively hot (but altogether cooler than the companion escape velocity) 'coronal' matter from the whole illuminated area. Under suitable conditions, wind particles spend some time trailing the companion at close distances before taking off to escape from the system. This can torque the binary into angular momentum loss that will be as efficient as the one recently observed in PSR 1957 + 20 if the companion is bloated to dimensions close to that of the Roche lobe.},

If the transfield thickness of the gap is thin, the created current density becomes sub-Goldreich-Julian, giving the traditional outer-gap solution but with negligible gamma-ray luminosity. As the thickness increases, the created current increases to become super-Goldreich-Julian, giving a new gap solution with substantially screened acceleration electric field in the inner part. In this case, the gap extends toward the neutron star with a small-amplitude positive acceleration field, extracting ions from the stellar surface as a space-charge-limited flow. The acceleration field is highly unscreened in the outer magnetosphere, resulting in a gamma-ray spectral shape that is consistent with the observations.},

	abstract = {We report on unusually very hard spectral states in three confirmed neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries (1RXS J180408.9-342058, EXO 1745-248, and IGR J18245-2452) at a luminosity between ~ 10^{36-37} erg s^{-1}. When fitting the Swift X-ray spectra (0.5 - 10 keV) in those states with an absorbed power-law model, we found photon indices of \Gamma ~ 1, significantly lower than the \Gamma = 1.5 - 2.0 typically seen when such systems are in their so called hard state. For individual sources very hard spectra were already previously identified but here we show for the first time that likely our sources were in a distinct spectral state (i.e., different from the hard state) when they exhibited such very hard spectra. It is unclear how such very hard spectra can be formed; if the emission mechanism is similar to that operating in their hard states (i.e., up-scattering of soft photons due to hot electrons) then the electrons should have higher temperatures or a higher optical depth in the very hard state compared to those observed in the hard state. By using our obtained \Gamma as a tracer for the spectral evolution with luminosity, we have compared our results with those obtained by Wijnands et al. (2015). We confirm their general results in that also our sample of sources follow the same track as the other neutron star systems, although we do not find that the accreting millisecond pulsars are systematically harder than the non-pulsating systems.},

	abstract = {We present the results of Very Large Array, Australia Telescope Compact Array, and Swift X-ray Telescope observations of the 2015 outburst of the transient neutron star X-ray binary (NSXB), EXO 1745-248, located in the globular cluster Terzan 5. Combining (near-) simultaneous radio and X-ray measurements, we measure a correlation between the radio and X-ray luminosities of L_R∝ L_X^beta with beta =1.68^{+0.10}_{-0.09}, linking the accretion flow (probed by X-ray luminosity) and the compact jet (probed by radio luminosity). While such a relationship has been studied in multiple black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), this work marks only the third NSXB with such a measurement. Constraints on this relationship in NSXBs are strongly needed, as comparing this correlation between different classes of XB systems is key in understanding the properties that affect the jet production process in accreting objects. Our best-fitting disc-jet coupling index for EXO 1745-248 is consistent with the measured correlation in NSXB 4U 1728-34 (beta = 1.5 $\pm$ 0.2) but inconsistent with the correlation we fit using the most recent measurements from the literature of NSXB Aql X-1 (beta =0.76^{+0.14}_{-0.15}). While a similar disc-jet coupling index appears to hold across multiple BHXBs in the hard accretion state, this does not appear to be the case with the three NSXBs measured so far. Additionally, the normalization of the EXO 1745-248 correlation is lower than the other two NSXBs, making it one of the most radio faint XBs ever detected in the hard state. We also report the detection of a type-I X-ray burst during this outburst, where the decay time-scale is consistent with hydrogen burning.},

@article{Matranga2017a,
	abstract = {CONTEXT - Transient low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) often show outbursts lasting typically a few-weeks and characterized by a high X-ray luminosity ($L_{x} \approx 10^{36}-10^{38}$ erg/sec), while for most of the time they are found in X-ray quiescence ($L_X\approx10^{31} -10^{33}$ erg/sec). EXO 1745-248 is one of them. AIMS - The broad-band coverage, and the sensitivity of instrument on board of {\xmm} and {\igr}, offers the opportunity to characterize the hard X-ray spectrum during {\exo} outburst. METHODS - In this paper we report on quasi-simultaneous {\xmm} and {\igr} observations of the X-ray transient {\exo} located in the globular cluster Terzan 5, performed ten days after the beginning of the outburst (on 2015 March 16th) shown by the source between March and June 2015. The source was caught in a hard state, emitting a 0.8-100 keV luminosity of $\simeq10^{37}$~{\lumcgs}. RESULTS - The spectral continuum was dominated by thermal Comptonization of seed photons with temperature $kT_{in}\simeq1.3$ keV, by a cloud with moderate optical depth $\tau\simeq2$ and electron temperature $kT_e\simeq 40$ keV. A weaker soft thermal component at temperature $kT_{th}\simeq0.6$--0.7 keV and compatible with a fraction of the neutron star radius was also detected. A rich emission line spectrum was observed by the EPIC-pn on-board {\xmm}; features at energies compatible with K-$\alpha$ transitions of ionized sulfur, argon, calcium and iron were detected, with a broadness compatible with either thermal Compton broadening or Doppler broadening in the inner parts of an accretion disk truncated at $20\pm6$ gravitational radii from the neutron star. Strikingly, at least one narrow emission line ascribed to neutral or mildly ionized iron is needed to model the prominent emission complex detected between 5.5 and 7.5 keV. (Abridged)},

	abstract = {A class of low-mass X-ray binary sources is known to be both X-ray burst sources and millisecond pulsars at the same time. A new source of this class was discovered by High Energy Transient Explorer 2 (HETE-2) on 2005 June 14 as a source of type-I X-ray bursts, which was named HETE J1900.1---2455. Five X-ray bursts from HETE J1900.1---2455 were observed during the summer of 2005. A time-resolved spectral analysis of these bursts has revealed that their spectra are consistent with the blackbody radiation throughout the bursts. The bursts show an indication of radius expansion. The bolometric flux remained almost constant during the photospheric radius expansion, while blackbody temperature dropped during the same period. Assuming that the flux reached the Eddington limit on a standard 1.4 solar-mass neutron star with a helium atmosphere, we estimate the distance to the source to be ˜ 4kpc.},

@article{Elebert2008a,
	abstract = {We present phase resolved optical photometry and spectroscopy of the accreting millisecond pulsar HETE J1900.1-2455. Our R-band light curves exhibit a sinusoidal modulation, at close to the orbital period, which we initially attributed to X-ray heating of the irradiated face of the secondary star. However, further analysis reveals that the source of the modulation is more likely due to superhumps caused by a precessing accretion disc. Doppler tomography of a broad Halpha emission line reveals an emission ring, consistent with that expected from an accretion disc. Using the velocity of the emission ring as an estimate for the projected outer disc velocity, we constrain the maximum projected velocity of the secondary to be 200 km s-1, placing a lower limit of 0.05 Msolar on the secondary mass. For a 1.4 Msolar primary, this implies that the orbital inclination is low, <~20$\,^{\circ}$. Utilizing the observed relationship between the secondary mass and the orbital period in short-period cataclysmic variables, we estimate the secondary mass to be ~0.085 Msolar, which implies an upper limit of ~2.4 Msolar for the primary mass.},

	abstract = {We present ongoing Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) monitoring observations of the 377.3 Hz accretion-powered pulsar, HETE J1900-2455. Activity continues in this system more than 3 yr after discovery, at a mean luminosity of 4.4×1036 erg s-1 (for d = 5 kpc), although pulsations were present only within the first 70 d. X-ray variability has increased each year, notably with a brief interval of non-detection in 2007, during which the luminosity dropped to below 10-3 of the mean level. A deep search of data from the intervals of non-detection in 2005 revealed evidence for extremely weak pulsations at an amplitude of 0.29% rms, a factor of ten less than the largest amplitude seen early in the outburst.  X-ray burst activity continued through 2008, with bursts typically featuring strong radius expansion. Spectral analysis of the most intense burst detected by RXTE early in the outburst revealed unusual variations in the inferred photospheric radius, as well as significant deviations from a black-body. We obtained much better fits instead with a Comptonization model.},

We perform thermal evolution calculations based on the 2016 quiescent data and a ≲98 eV temperature upper limit inferred from a Swift observation taken during an unusually brief (≲2 weeks) quiescent episode in 2007. We find no evidence in the present data that the thermal properties of the crust, such as the heating rate and thermal conductivity, are different than those of non-pulsating neutron stars. Finding this neutron star so cold after its long outburst imposes interesting constraints on the heat capacity of the stellar core; these become even stronger if further cooling were to occur.},

	abstract = {We report on the first 10 weeks of RXTE observations of the X-ray transient XTE J1701-462 and conclude that it had all the characteristics of the neutron star Z sources, i.e., the brightest persistent neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. These include the typical Z-shaped tracks traced out in X-ray color diagrams and the variability components detected in the power spectra, such as kHz QPOs and normal and horizontal branch oscillations. XTE J1701-462 is the first transient Z source and provides unique insights into mass accretion rate (m˙) and luminosity dependencies in neutron star X-ray binaries. As its overall luminosity decreased, we observed a switch between two types of Z source behavior, with the branches of the Z track changing their shape and/or orientation. We interpret this as an extreme case of the more moderate long-term changes seen in the persistent Z sources and suggest that they result from changes in m˙. We also suggest that the Cyg-like Z sources (Cyg X-2, GX 5-1, and GX 340+0) are substantially more luminous (>50%) than the Sco-like Z sources (Sco X-1, GX 17+2, and GX 349+2). Adopting a possible explanation for the behavior of kHz QPOs, which involves a prompt as well as a filtered response to changes in m˙, we further propose that changes in m˙ can explain both movement along the Z track and changes in the shape of the Z track. We discuss some consequences of this and consider the possibility that the branches of the Z will smoothly evolve into the branches observed in X-ray color diagrams of the less luminous atoll sources, although not in a way that was previously suggested.},

@article{Homan2010a,
	abstract = {We report on an analysis of Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer data of the transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) XTE J1701-462, obtained during its 2006-2007 outburst. The X-ray properties of the source changed between those of various types of NS-LMXB subclasses. At high luminosities, the source switched between two types of Z source behavior and at low luminosities we observed a transition from Z source to atoll source behavior. These transitions between subclasses primarily manifest themselves as changes in the shapes of the tracks in X-ray color-color (CD) and hardness-intensity diagrams (HID), but they are accompanied by changes in the kHz quasi-periodic oscillations, broadband variability, burst behavior, and/or X-ray spectra. We find that for most of the outburst the low-energy X-ray flux is a good parameter to track the gradual evolution of the tracks in CD and HID, allowing us to resolve the evolution of the source in greater detail than before and relate the observed properties to other NS-LMXBs. We further find that during the transition from Z to atoll, characteristic behavior known as the atoll upper banana can equivalently be described as the final stage of a weakening Z source flaring branch, thereby blurring the line between the two subclasses. Our findings strongly suggest that the wide variety in behavior observed in NS-LXMBs with different luminosities can be linked through changes in a single variable parameter, namely the mass accretion rate, without the need for additional differences in the neutron star parameters or viewing angle. We briefly discuss the implications of our findings for the spectral changes observed in NS-LMXBs and suggest that, contrary to what is often assumed, the position along the color-color tracks of Z sources is not determined by the instantaneous mass accretion rate.},

	abstract = {Cool stars like the Sun harbor convection zones capable of producing substantial surface magnetic fields leading to stellar magnetic activity. The influence of stellar parameters like rotation, radius, and age on cool-star magnetism, and the importance of the shear layer between a radiative core and the convective envelope for the generation of magnetic fields are keys for our understanding of low-mass stellar dynamos, the solar dynamo, and also for other large-scale and planetary dynamos. Our observational picture of cool-star magnetic fields has improved tremendously over the last years. Sophisticated methods were developed to search for the subtle effects of magnetism, which are difficult to detect particularly in cool stars. With an emphasis on the assumptions and capabilities of modern methods used to measure magnetism in cool stars, I review the different techniques available for magnetic field measurements. I collect the analyses on cool-star magnetic fields and try to compare results from different methods, and I review empirical evidence that led to our current picture of magnetic fields and their generation in cool stars and brown dwarfs.},

@article{Breton2013a,
	abstract = {In the last few years, over 43 millisecond radio pulsars have been discovered by targeted searches of unidentified gamma-ray sources found by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. A large fraction of these millisecond pulsars are in compact binaries with low-mass companions. These systems often show eclipses of the pulsar signal and are commonly known as black widows and redbacks because the pulsar is gradually destroying its companion. In this paper, we report on the optical discovery of four strongly irradiated millisecond pulsar companions. All four sources show modulations of their color and luminosity at the known orbital periods from radio timing. Light curve modeling of our exploratory data shows that the equilibrium temperature reached on the companion's dayside with respect to their nightside is consistent with about 10%-30% of the available spin-down energy from the pulsar being reprocessed to increase the companion's dayside temperature. This value compares well with the range observed in other irradiated pulsar binaries and offers insights about the energetics of the pulsar wind and the production of gamma-ray emission. In addition, this provides a simple way of estimating the brightness of irradiated pulsar companions given the pulsar spin-down luminosity. Our analysis also suggests that two of the four new irradiated pulsar companions are only partially filling their Roche lobe. Some of these sources are relatively bright and represent good targets for spectroscopic follow-up. These measurements could enable, among other things, mass determination of the neutron stars in these systems.},

This data set, which is the longest published to date for a black-widow system, allows for an improved analysis that addresses previously unknown biases. While secular variations, as identified in previous analyses, are recovered, short-term variations are detected for the first time. Concurrently, a significant decrease of ˜ 2.5 × 10- 3 cm- 3 pc in the dispersion measure associated with PSR J2051-0827 is measured for the first time and improvements are also made to estimates of the proper motion. Finally, PSR J2051-0827 is shown to have entered a relatively stable state suggesting the possibility of its eventual inclusion in pulsar timing arrays.},

	abstract = {We report the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) detection of a $\gamma$-ray source at the position of SAX J1808.4$-$3658. This transient low-mass X-ray binary contains an accreting millisecond puslar, which is only seen during its month-long outbursts and likely switches to be rotation powered during its quiescent state. Emission from the $\gamma$-ray source can be described by a power law with an exponential cutoff, the characteristic form for pulsar emission. Folding the source's 2.0--300 GeV photons at the binary orbital period, a weak modulation is seen (with an H-test value of $\sim$17). In addition, three sets of archival XMM-Newton data for the source field are analyzed, and we find only one X-ray source with 3--4$\sigma$ flux variations in the 2$\sigma$ error circle of the $\gamma$-ray source. However based on the X-ray properties, this X-ray source is not likely a background AGN, the major class of Fermi sources detected by LAT. These results support the possible association between the $\gamma$-ray source and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 and thus the scenario that the millisecond pulsar is rotation powered in the quiescent state. Considering a source distance of 3.5 kpc for SAX J1808.4$-$3658, the 0.1--300 GeV luminosity is 5.7$\times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$, implying a $\gamma$-ray conversion efficiency of 63\% for the pulsar in this binary.},

	abstract = {Observational evidences of erratic 1st harmonic pulse phase shifts in accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars pulse phase evolution was reported by several authors. This effect always go together with much more stable 2nd harmonics pulse phase delays. Different possible explanations of these phase shifts have been given in literature. But all these interpretations do not explain why the 2nd harmonic are more stable than the 1st harmonic. The explanation of such a behaviour is of fundamental importance in order to gain an insight on the NS rotational behaviour and to remove the still present interpretative ambiguity on the results of timing analysis. We propose a simple toy-model to interpret these phenomena as effect of small variations of the ratio between the fluxes from the two hot-spots. We show how it affects the phase of the overall pulse profile, when the two amplitudes are similar and the two hot-spots are not perfectly antipodal. Using this model, we give a detailed explanation of the phase jump observed in the 2002 outburst of SAX J1808.4-3658.},

	abstract = {The accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 shows peculiar low luminosity states known as ``reflares'' after the end of the main outburst. During this phase the X-ray luminosity of the source varies by up to three orders of magnitude in less than 1-2 days. The lowest X-ray luminosity observed reaches a value of ˜ {10}32 {erg} {{{s}}}-1, only a factor of a few brighter than its typical quiescent level. We investigate the 2008 and 2005 reflaring state of SAX J1808.4-3658 to determine whether there is any evidence for a change in the accretion flow with respect to the main outburst. We perform a multiwavelength photometric and spectral study of the 2005 and 2008 reflares with data collected during an observational campaign covering the near-infrared, optical, ultra-violet and X-ray band. We find that the NIR/optical/UV emission, expected to come from the outer accretion disk, shows variations in luminosity over an order of magnitude. The corresponding X-ray luminosity variations are instead much deeper, spanning about 2-3 orders of magnitude. The X-ray spectral state observed during the reflares does not change substantially with X-ray luminosity, indicating a rather stable configuration of the accretion flow. We investigate the most likely configuration of the innermost regions of the accretion flow and we infer an accretion disk truncated at or near the co-rotation radius. We interpret these findings as due to either a strong outflow (due to a propeller effect) or a trapped disk (with limited/no outflow) in the inner regions of the accretion flow.},

	abstract = {Millisecond radio pulsars are neutron stars that have been spun up by the transfer of angular momentum during the low-mass X-ray binary phase. The transition from an accretion-powered pulsar to a rotation-powered pulsar takes place on evolutionary timescales at the end of the accretion process; however, it may also occur sporadically in systems undergoing transient X-ray activity. We have obtained the first optical spectrum of the low-mass transient X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 in quiescence. Similar to the black widow millisecond pulsar B1957+20, this X-ray pulsar shows a large optical modulation at the orbital period due to an irradiated companion star. Using the brightness of the companion star as a bolometer, we conclude that a very high irradiating luminosity, a factor of ~100 larger than directly observed, must be present in the system. This most likely derives from a rotation-powered neutron star that resumes activity during quiescence.},

	abstract = {SAX J1808.4-3658 is a unique source, being the first low-mass X-ray binary showing coherent pulsations at a spin period comparable to that of millisecond radio pulsars. Here we present an XMM-Newton observation of SAX J1808.4-3658 in quiescence, the first that assessed its quiescent luminosity and spectrum with a good signal-to-noise ratio. XMM-Newton did not reveal other sources in the vicinity of SAX J1808.4-3658, likely indicating that the source was also detected by previous BeppoSAX and ASCA observations, even with large positional and flux uncertainties. We derive a 0.5-10 keV unabsorbed luminosity of LX=5×1031 ergs s-1, a relatively low value compared with other neutron star soft X-ray transient sources. At variance with other soft X-ray transients, the quiescent spectrum of SAX J1808.4-3658 was dominated by a hard (Gamma~1.5) power law with only a minor contribution (<~10%) from a soft blackbody component. If the power law originates in the shock between the wind of a turned-on radio pulsar and matter outflowing from the companion, then a spin-down to an X-ray luminosity conversion efficiency of eta~10-3 is derived; this is in line with the value estimated from the eclipsing radio pulsar PSR J1740-5340. Within the deep crustal heating model, the faintness of the blackbody-like component indicates that SAX J1808.4-3658 likely hosts a massive neutron star (M>~1.7 Msolar).},

We take into account the fact that X-ray heating is non-spherical and show that this modifies the results obtained in models which assume spherically symmetric illumination. Our results suggest that the effects of X-ray heating have been largely overestimated in earlier papers. We also show that radiation-induced winds in LMXBs with orbital periods less than 10 hr cannot give mass transfer rates larger than about one tenth of the Eddington limit mass flux, making it unlikely that such self-sustained winds have a marked effect on LMXB evolution, contrary to the suggestion of Tavani (1991).

	abstract = {The study of outer disc radius variations in close binary systems is important for understanding the structure and evolution of accretion discs. These variations are predicted by models of both quasi-steady and time-dependent discs, and these predictions can be confronted with observations. We consider theoretical and observational consequences of such variations in cataclysmic variables and low-mass X-ray binaries. We find that the action of tidal torques, that determine the outer radius at which the disc is truncated, must be important also well inside the tidal radius. We conclude that it is doubtful that the tidal-thermal instability is responsible for the superoutburst/superhump phenomena in dwarf novae, and confirm that it cannot be the reason for the outbursts of soft X-ray transients. It is likely that tidal torques play a role during superoutbursts of very-low mass-ratio systems but they cannot be the main and only cause of superhumps.},

	abstract = {We report multi-wavelength observations of the unidentified Fermi object 2FGL J1653.6-0159. With the help of high-resolution X-ray observations, we have identified an X-ray and optical counterpart to 2FGL J1653.6-0159. The source exhibits a periodic modulation of 75 minutes in the optical and possibly also in the X-ray. We suggest that 2FGL J1653.6-0159 is a compact binary system with an orbital period of 75 minutes. Combining the gamma-ray and X-ray properties, 2FGL J1653.6-0159 is potentially a black-widow-/redback-type gamma-ray millisecond pulsar (MSP). The optical and X-ray light curve profiles show that the companion is mildly heated by the high-energy emission and that the X-rays are from intrabinary shock. Although no radio pulsation has yet been detected, we estimated that the spin period of the MSP is ~ 2 ms based on a theoretical model. If pulsation can be confirmed in the future, 2FGL J1653.6-0159 will become the first ultracompact rotation-powered MSP.},

@article{Hameury1996a,
	abstract = {I discuss the effects of illumination of a main sequence star by high energy particles or gamma-ray photons on its structure. It is shown that energy can be deposited at large depths (up to about 100g/cm2) in the outer layers of the stellar envelope. This is deep enough for the circulation time scale of matter at the surface of the star to be longer than or comparable to the cooling time of the heated layers; the spherically symmetric assumption may therefore hold. In the case of low mass X-ray binaries, the illumination flux at these high energies is not sufficient to affect the scenario proposed by Hameury et al. (1993), and the secular evolution of these systems is not very different from that of unilluminated systems, although episodes with large mass transfer rates are expected. On the other hand, the situation is quite different in systems in which the compact object is a millisecond pulsar. A very significant expansion of the secondary is expected, which makes its total evaporation easier.},

	abstract = {Aims: We aim both to complement the existing data on the spin history of the peculiar accreting X-ray pulsar GX 1+4 with more past and current data from BeppoSAX, INTEGRAL, and Fermi and to interpret the evolution in the framework of accretion theory.  Methods: We used source light curves obtained from BeppoSAX/WFC and INTEGRAL/ISGRI to derive pulse periods using an epoch-folding analysis. Fermi/GBM data were analysed by fitting a constant plus a Fourier expansion to background-subtracted rates, and maximizing the Y2 statistic. We completed the sample with hard X-ray light curves from Swift/BAT. The data were checked for correlations between flux and changes of the pulsar spin on different timescales.  Results: The spin-down of the pulsar continues with a constant change in frequency, i.e., an apparently accelerating change in the period. Over the past three decades, the pulse period has increased by about ~50%. Short-term fluctuations on top of this long-term trend do show anti-correlation with the source flux. Possible explanations of the observed long-term frequency and its dependence on flux are discussed.  Appendix B is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	abstract = {We present an X-ray eclipse timing analysis of the transient low mass X-ray binary XTE J1710-281. We report observations of 57 complete X-ray eclipses, spread over more than a decade of observations, made with the proportional counter array detectors aboard the RXTE satellite. Using the eclipse timing technique, we have derived a constant orbital period of 0.136 710 9674 (3) d, during the period from MJD 52132 up to MJD 54410, and 1sigma limits of -1.6 × 10-12 and 0.2 × 10-12 d d-1, on the period derivative, ?. This puts constraints on the minimum time-scale of secular orbital period evolution (?) of 2.34 × 108 yr for a period decay and 18.7 × 108 yr for a period increase. We also report detection of two instances of discontinuity in the mid-eclipse time, one before and one after the above MJD range. These results are interpreted as three distinct epochs of orbital period in XTE J1710-281. We have put lower limits of 1.4 and 0.9 ms on orbital period change (DeltaPorb) at successive epochs. The detection significance of the two orbital period glitches are 11sigma and 4sigma, respectively. The sudden changes in orbital period is very similar in nature to that observed in EXO 0748-676, though their magnitude is much smaller in XTE J1710-281.},

	abstract = {We interpret the stellar population of omega Centauri by means of a population synthesis analysis, following the most recent observational guidelines for input metallicities, helium and [(C+N+O)/Fe] contents. We deal at the same time with the main sequences, sub-giant and horizontal branch (HB) data. The reproduction of the observed colour-magnitude features is very satisfying and bears interesting hints concerning the evolutionary history of this peculiar stellar ensemble. Our main results are: (1) no significant spread in age is required to fit the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed, we can use coeval isochrones for the synthetic populations, and we estimate that the ages fall within a ˜0.5 Gyr time interval; in particular the most metal-rich population can be coeval (in the above meaning) with the others, if its stars are very helium-rich (Y ˜ 0.37) and with the observed CNO enhancement ([(C+N+O)/Fe] = +0.7); (2) a satisfactory fit of the whole HB is obtained, consistent with the choice of the populations providing a good reproduction of the main sequence and sub-giant data; (3) the split in magnitude observed in the red HB is well reproduced assuming the presence of two stellar populations in the two different sequences observed: a metal-poor population made of stars evolving from the blue side (luminous branch) and a metal richer one whose stars are in a stage closer to the zero age HB (dimmer branch). This modelization also fits satisfactorily the period and the [Fe/H] distribution of the RR Lyrae stars.},

@article{Tailo2015a,
	abstract = {Horizontal branch stars belong to an advanced stage in the evolution of the oldest stellar galactic population, occurring either as field halo stars or grouped in globular clusters. The discovery of multiple populations in clusters that were previously believed to have single populations gave rise to the currently accepted theory that the hottest horizontal branch members (the `blue hook' stars, which had late helium-core flash ignition, followed by deep mixing) are the progeny of a helium-rich `second generation' of stars. It is not known why such a supposedly rare event (a late flash followed by mixing) is so common that the blue hook of omega Centauri contains approximately 30 per cent of the horizontal branch stars in the cluster, or why the blue hook luminosity range in this massive cluster cannot be reproduced by models. Here we report that the presence of helium core masses up to about 0.04 solar masses larger than the core mass resulting from evolution is required to solve the luminosity range problem. We model this by taking into account the dispersion in rotation rates achieved by the progenitors, whose pre-main-sequence accretion disk suffered an early disruption in the dense environment of the cluster's central regions, where second-generation stars form. Rotation may also account for frequent late-flash-mixing events in massive globular clusters.},

	abstract = {{We present the results of extensive evolutionary computations from the Zero Age Main Sequence to the Red Giants, for stars in the range 0.6 /15 M_sun and with chemistry (Y, Z) = (0.274, 0.017). The novelty of these computations is in the general treatment of convection, namely: 1. convection as a whole is addressed in the Full Spectrum of Turbulence model (billions of eddy scales are considered) with the appropriate convective fluxes distribution, as opposed to the one-eddy Mixing Length Theory; 2. local chemical evolution also in the presence of convection is separately evaluated for each element, as a result of a process in which nuclear evolution and turbulent transport are fully coupled by means of a diffusive scheme (coupled-diffusion); 3. convective overshooting (when considered) is also addressed in the above coupled-diffusive scheme, assuming that the turbulent velocity exponentially vanishes outside the formally convective region according to an e-folding free parameter zeta , tuned to fit observations. After some tests on the small solar convective core in early main sequence, we discuss the effects of coupled-diffusion in the cores of larger mass stars, where the nuclear lifetimes of some (p-p and) CNO elements can be comparable to the mixing times. We also compute a full grid of tracks with a small amount of overshooting, finding that a unique free parameter can be suitable for the whole range of mass considered (solar and below solar included). Theoretical tracks are discussed, and isochrones are compared to the observational HR diagram for the Pleiades, finding an age > 120 Myr, consistent with that obtained from the candidate brown dwarf PPL 15. An age is also derived for the young cluster alpha Persei, for which a datation from the detection of lithium in brown dwarf candidates should be soon available. For completeness, and to facilitate comparisons with results by other authors, we also describe in details the ATON 2.0 code used for the present computations.}},

Erratic variations in X-ray flux are seen during approximately 25 percent of the 7.1 hr cycle; at the end of this period, a stable dip in the flux occurs. Further analysis indicates that this dip is, in all probability, an eclipse by the companion star in the low-mass binary system. The short (about 15 minute) eclipse duration is used to refine the period determination (7.114104 + or - 0.000168 hr) and to constrain the companion star mass and binary system parameters. The companion star is found to be in the range 0.25-0.9 solar mass; probabilistic arguments and observations of cataclysmic variables with comparable periods indicate that the companion star is most likely less massive than the standard theories would indicate.},

	abstract = {In April 1999 the transient low-mass X-ray binary X1658-298 resumed its strong and persistent X-ray emission after a 21 yr interval of quiescence. We present RXTE data obtained soon after the reappearance, including four eclipses with a mean duration of 901.9+/-0.8 s and ingress/egress times of 6-13 s. Our updated ephemeris for the source indicates that the 7.1 hr orbital period of the system is decreasing with a timescale of 107 yr. Contemporaneous optical observations provide the first ever light curve of V2134 Oph, the optical counterpart of X1658-298. The optical modulation is highly variable from night to night and exhibits a distinct, narrow eclipse feature of about 0.2 mag superposed on a gradual brightness variation with ~0.7-0.8 mag amplitude. Our data indicate that there is no significant offset between the time of mideclipse in the X-ray and optical and that the narrow optical eclipse feature is of the same duration as the X-ray eclipse. This implies an accretion disk structure characterized by enhanced optical emission coincident with the central X-ray-emitting area.},

@article{van-Doesburgh2017a,
	abstract = {We analyse all available RXTE data on a sample of 13 low-mass X-ray binaries with known neutron star spin that are not persistent pulsars. We carefully measure the correlations between the centroid frequencies of the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). We compare these correlations to the prediction of the relativistic precession model that, due to frame dragging, a QPO will occur at the Lense-Thirring precession frequency nuLT of a test-particle orbit whose orbital frequency is the upper kHz QPO frequency nuu. Contrary to the most prominent previous studies, we find two different oscillations in the range predicted for nuLT that are simultaneously present over a wide range of nuu. Additionally, one of the low-frequency noise components evolves into a (third) QPO in the nuLT range when nuu exceeds 600 Hz. The frequencies of these QPOs all correlate to nuu following power laws with indices between 0.4 and 3.3, significantly exceeding the predicted value of 2.0 in 80 per cent of the cases (at 3 to >20sigma). Also, there is no evidence that the neutron star spin frequency affects any of these three QPO frequencies, as would be expected for frame dragging. Finally, the observed QPO frequencies tend to be higher than the nuLT predicted for reasonable neutron star specific moment of inertia. In the light of recent successes of precession models in black holes, we briefly discuss ways in which such precession can occur in neutron stars at frequencies different from test-particle values and consistent with those observed. A precessing torus geometry and other torques than frame dragging may allow precession to produce the observed frequency correlations, but can only explain one of the three QPOs in the nuLT range.},

@article{De-Falco2016a,
	abstract = {IGR J00291+5934 is the fastest-known accretion-powered X-ray pulsar, discovered during a transient outburst in 2004. In this paper, we report on Integral and Swift observations during the 2015 outburst, which lasts for $\sim25$ d. The source has not been observed in outburst since 2008, suggesting that the long-term accretion rate has decreased by a factor of two since discovery. The averaged broad-band (0.1 - 250 keV) persistent spectrum in 2015 is well described by a thermal Comptonization model with a column density of $N_{\rm H} \approx4\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, a plasma temperature of $kT_{\rm e} \approx50$ keV, and a Thomson optical depth of $\tau_{\rm T}\approx1$. Pulsations at the known spin period of the source are detected in the Integral data up to the $\sim150$ keV energy band. We also report on the discovery of the first thermonuclear burst observed from IGR J00291+5934, which lasts around 7 min and occurs at a persistent emission level corresponding to roughly $1.6\%$ of the Eddington accretion rate. The properties of the burst suggest it is powered primarily by helium ignited at a depth of $y_{\rm ign}\approx1.5\times10^9$ g cm$^{-2}$ following the exhaustion by steady burning of the accreted hydrogen. The Swift/BAT data from the first $\sim20$ s of the burst provide indications of a photospheric radius expansion phase. Assuming this is the case, we infer a source distance of $d = 4.2 \pm 0.3$ kpc.},

	abstract = {In a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), mass accreted onto a neutron star from a larger companion generates a flux of X-rays which irradiate the companion. It is shown here that, under the radiative flux typical of an LMXB, the companion will expand towards a new state of thermal equilibrium and that this expansion provides a new mechanism to drive mass transfer onto the neutron star. The evolution of LMXBs can be drastically altered in this way. In particular, this mechanism may introduce a new evolutionary phase during which the orbital period increases, leading to larger orbital periods during and at the end of mass transfer and shortening the duration of the LMXB phase.},

	abstract = {We fitted the $3-180$-keV spectrum of all the observations of the neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636$-$53 taken with the {\it Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer} using a model that includes a thermal Comptonisation component. We found that in the low-hard state the power-law index of this component, $\Gamma$, gradually increases as the source moves in the colour-colour diagram. When the source undergoes a transition from the hard to the soft state $\Gamma$ drops abruptly; once the source is in the soft state $\Gamma$ increases again and then decreases gradually as the source spectrum softens further. The changes in $\Gamma$, together with changes of the electron temperature, reflect changes of the optical depth in the corona. The lower kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (kHz QPO) in this source appears only in observations during the transition from the hard to the soft state, when the optical depth of the corona is high and changes depends strongly upon the position of the source in the colour-colour diagram. Our results are consistent with a scenario in which the lower kHz QPO reflects a global mode in the system that results from the resonance between, the disc and/or the neutron-star surface, and the Comptonising corona.},

@article{Iaria2016a,
	abstract = {Context. The source 4U 1702-429 (Ara X-1) is a low-mass X-ray binary system hosting a neutron star. Albeit the source is quite bright ( 1037 erg s-1) its broadband spectrum has never been studied. Neither dips nor eclipses have been observed in the light curve suggesting that its inclination angle is smaller than 60$\,^{\circ}$.  Aims: We analysed the broadband spectrum of 4U 1702-429 in the 0.3-60 keV energy range, using XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL data, to constrain its Compton reflection component if it is present.  Methods: After excluding the three time intervals in which three type-I X-ray bursts occurred, we fitted the joint XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL spectra obtained from simultaneous observations.  Results: A broad emission line at 6.7 keV and two absorption edges at 0.87 and 8.82 keV were detected. We found that a self-consistent reflection model fits the 0.3-60 keV spectrum well. The broadband continuum is composed of an emission component originating from the inner region of the accretion disc, a Comptonised direct emission coming from a corona with an electron temperature of 2.63 $\pm$ 0.06 keV and an optical depth tau = 13.6 $\pm$ 0.2, and, finally, a reflection component. The best-fit indicates that the broad emission line and the absorption edge at 8.82 keV, both associated with the presence of Fe xxv ions, are produced by reflection in the region above the disc with a ionisation parameter of Log(xi) ~= 2.7. We have inferred that the inner radius, where the broad emission line originates, is km, and the inner radius of the accretion disc is km. The emissivity of the reflection component and the inclination angle of the system are and degrees, respectively. The absorption edge at 0.87 keV is associated to the presence of O viii ions and it is produced in a region above the disc with Log(xi) ~= 1.9.},

@article{DAi2016a,
	abstract = {We report on the discovery and energy dependence of hard phase lags in the 2.14 Hz pulsed profiles of GRO J1744-28. We used data from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. We were able to well constrain the lag spectrum with respect to the softest (0.3-2.3 keV) band: the delay shows increasing lag values reaching a maximum delay of ˜12 ms, between 6 and 6.4 keV. After this maximum, the value of the hard lag drops to ˜7 ms, followed by a recovery to a plateau at ˜9 ms for energies above 8 keV. NuSTAR data confirm this trend up to 30 keV, but the measurements are statistically poorer, and therefore, less constraining. The lag-energy pattern up to the discontinuity is well described by a logarithmic function. Assuming this is due to a Compton reverberation mechanism, we derive a size for the Compton cloud Rcc ˜ 120 Rg, consistent with previous estimates on the magnetospheric radius. In this scenario, the sharp discontinuity at ˜6.5 keV appears difficult to interpret and suggests the possible influence of the reflected component in this energy range. We therefore propose the possible coexistence of both Compton and disc reverberation to explain the scale of the lags and its energy dependence.},

	abstract = {We report on a 10 ks simultaneous Chandra/High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG)-Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observation of the Bursting Pulsar, GRO J1744-28, during its third detected outburst since discovery and after nearly 18 yr of quiescence. The source is detected up to 60 keV with an Eddington persistent flux level. Seven bursts, followed by dips, are seen with Chandra, three of which are also detected with NuSTAR. Timing analysis reveals a slight increase in the persistent emission pulsed fraction with energy (from 10% to 15%) up to 10 keV, above which it remains constant. The 0.5-70 keV spectra of the persistent and dip emission are the same within errors and well described by a blackbody (BB), a power-law (PL) with an exponential rolloff, a 10 keV feature, and a 6.7 keV emission feature, all modified by neutral absorption. Assuming that the BB emission originates in an accretion disk, we estimate its inner (magnetospheric) radius to be about 4 × 107 cm, which translates to a surface dipole field B ≈ 9 × 1010 G. The Chandra/HETG spectrum resolves the 6.7 keV feature into (quasi-)neutral and highly ionized Fe xxv and Fe xxvi emission lines. XSTAR modeling shows these lines to also emanate from a truncated accretion disk. The burst spectra, with a peak flux more than an order of magnitude higher than Eddington, are well fit with a PL with an exponential rolloff and a 10 keV feature, with similar fit values compared to the persistent and dip spectra. The burst spectra lack a thermal component and any Fe features. Anisotropic (beamed) burst emission would explain both the lack of the BB and any Fe components.},

	abstract = {A millisecond pulsar is a neutron star that has been substantially spun up by accretion from a binary companion. A previously unrecognized factor governing the spin evolution of such pulsars is the crucial effect of non-steady or transient accretion. We numerically compute the evolution of accreting neutron stars through a series of outburst and quiescent phases considering the drastic variation of the accretion rate and the standard disk-magnetosphere interaction. We find that, for the same long-term average accretion rate, X-ray transients can spin up pulsars to rates several times higher than can persistent accretors, even when the spin down due to electromagnetic radiation during quiescence is included. We also compute an analytical expression for the equilibrium spin frequency in transients, by taking spin equilibrium to mean that no net angular momentum is transferred to the neutron star in each outburst cycle. We find that the equilibrium spin rate for transients, which depends on the peak accretion rate during outbursts, can be much higher than that for persistent sources. This explains our numerical finding. This finding implies that any meaningful study of neutron star spin and magnetic field distributions requires the inclusion of the transient accretion effect, since most accreting neutron star sources are transients. Our finding also implies the existence of a submillisecond pulsar population, which is not observed. This may point to the need for a competing spin-down mechanism for the fastest-rotating accreting pulsars, such as gravitational radiation.},

@article{Di-Salvo2015a,
	abstract = {Iron emission lines at 6.4-6.97 keV, identified with Kalpha radiative transitions, are among the strongest discrete features in the X-ray band. These are one of the most powerful probes to infer the properties of the plasma in the innermost part of the accretion disc around a compact object. In this paper, we present a recent Suzaku observation, 100-ks effective exposure, of the atoll source and X-ray burster 4U 1705-44, where we clearly detect signatures of a reflection component which is distorted by the high-velocity motion in the accretion disc. The reflection component consists of a broad iron line at about 6.4 keV and a Compton bump at high X-ray energies, around 20 keV. All these features are consistently fitted with a reflection model, and we find that in the hard state the smearing parameters are remarkably similar to those found in a previous XMM-Newton observation performed in the soft state. In particular, we find that the inner disc radius is Rin = 17 $\pm$ 5Rg (where Rg is the gravitational radius, GM/c2), the emissivity dependence from the disc radius is r-2.5 $\pm$ 0.5, the inclination angle with respect to the line of sight is i = 43$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 5$\,^{\circ}$, and the outer radius of the emitting region in the disc is Rout > 200Rg. We note that the accretion disc does not appear to be truncated at large radii, although the source is in a hard state at ˜3 per cent of the Eddington luminosity for a neutron star. We also find evidence of a broad emission line at low energies, at 3.03 $\pm$ 0.03 keV, compatible with emission from mildly ionized argon (Ar XVI-XVII). Argon transitions are not included in the self-consistent reflection models that we used and we therefore added an extra component to our model to fit this feature. The low-energy line appears compatible with being smeared by the same inner disc parameters found for the reflection component.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we report on the analysis of the peculiar X-ray variability displayed by the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J00291+5934 in a 80 ks-long joint NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observation performed during the source outburst in 2015. The light curve of the source was characterized by a flaring-like behavior, with typical rise and decay time scales of ~120 s. The flares are accompanied by a remarkable spectral variability, with the X-ray emission being generally softer at the peak of the flares. A strong quasi periodic oscillation (QPO) is detected at ~8 mHz in the power spectrum of the source and clearly associated with the flaring-like behavior. This feature has the strongest power at soft X-rays (<3 keV). We carried out a dedicated hardness-ratio resolved spectral analysis and a QPO phase-resolved spectral analysis, together with an in-depth study of the source timing properties, to investigate the origin of this behavior. We suggest that the unusual variability of IGR J00291+5934 observed by XMM-Newton and NuSTAR could be produced by an heartbeat-like mechanism, similar to that operating in black-hole X-ray binaries. The possibility that this variability, and the associated QPO, are triggered by phases of quasi-stable nuclear burning, as suggested in the literature for a number of other neutron star binaries displaying a similar behavior, cannot be solidly tested in the case of IGR J00291+5934 due to the paucity of type-I X-ray bursts observed from this source.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the X-ray variability of three symbiotic X-ray binaries, GX 1+4, 4U 1700+24, and 4U 1954+31, using observations made with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) All-Sky Monitor (ASM). Observations of 4U 1954+31 with the Swift BAT show modulation at a period near 5 hr. Models to explain this modulation are discussed, including the presence of an exceptionally slow X-ray pulsar in the system and accretion instabilities. We conclude that the most likely interpretation is that 4U 1954+31 contains one of the slowest known X-ray pulsars. Unlike 4U 1954+31, neither GX 1+4 nor 4U 1700+24 show any evidence for modulation on a timescale of hours. An analysis of the RXTE ASM light curves of GX 1+4, 4U 1700+24, and 4U 1954+31 does not show the presence of periodic modulation in any source, with the exception of a possible detection of the 5 hr period in 4U 1954+31, although there is considerable variability on long timescales for all three sources. There is no modulation in GX 1+4 on either the optical 1161 day orbital period or a previously reported 304 day X-ray period. For 4U 1700+24 we do not confirm the 404 day X-ray period previously proposed for this source from a shorter duration ASM light curve. We conclude that all three sources have substantial low-frequency noise in their power spectra that may give the appearance of periodic modulation if this noise is not properly accounted for, particularly if short-duration light curves are examined.},

@article{Hinkle2006a,
	abstract = {We have computed, using 17 infrared radial velocities, the first set of orbital elements for the M giant in the symbiotic binary V2116 Ophiuchi. The giant's companion is a neutron star, the bright X-ray source GX 1+4. We rule out the previously proposed period of 304 days and instead find an orbital period of 1161 days, by far the longest of any known X-ray binary. The orbit has a modest eccentricity of 0.10, with an orbital circularization time of <~5×106 yr. The large mass function of the orbit significantly restricts the mass of the M giant. Adopting a neutron star mass of 1.35 Msolar, the maximum mass of the M giant is 1.22 Msolar, making it the less massive star. Spectrum synthesis analysis of several infrared spectral regions results in slightly subsolar abundances for most metals. Carbon and nitrogen are in the expected ratio resulting from the red-giant first dredge-up phase. The lack of 17O suggests that the M giant has a mass less than 1.3 Msolar, consistent with our maximum mass. The surface gravity and maximum mass of the M giant result in a radius of 103 Rsolar, much smaller than its estimated Roche lobe radius. Thus, the mass loss of the red giant is via a stellar wind. These properties argue that the M giant is near the tip of the first-ascent giant branch. Although the M-giant companion to the neutron star has a mass similar to the late-type star in low-mass X-ray binaries, its near-solar abundances and apparent runaway velocity are not fully consistent with the properties of this class of stars. Thus, in many ways this symbiotic X-ray binary system is unique, and various scenarios for its possible evolution are discussed.},

	abstract = {Aims:We present the results of the INTEGRAL monitoring campaign on the accreting low mass X-ray binary pulsar GX 1+4 performed during the Galactic plane scan of the INTEGRAL Core Programme.  Methods: The source was observed in different luminosity states ranging from L20-40 keV= 1.7 × 10-10 erg cm-2 s^{-1}, to L20-40 keV= 10.5 × 10-10 erg cm-2 s^{-1} for about 779 ks from March 2003 until October 2004. Results: Our observations confirm the secular spin down of GX 1+4 with the spin period (P_s) varying from 139.63 s to 141.56 s. In the highest luminosity state, a spin-up phase is observed. The phase-averaged spectrum of the source was modelled either with an absorbed cut-off power law or with a Comptonization model with significantly different parameters in the two brightest luminosity states. No evidence of any absorption-like feature is observed in the phase averaged spectrum up to 110 keV. At highest luminosity, the source is found to pulsate up to 130 keV. Phase resolved spectroscopy reveals a phase-dependent continuum and marginal evidence for an absorption feature at 34$\pm$2 keV in the descending part of the pulse. If interpreted as due to electron resonant cyclotron scattering, the magnetic field in the emitting region would be (2.9$\pm$0.2) × 1012 (1+z) G where z is the gravitational red shift of the emitting region. We also observed a very low luminosity state, typical of this source, which lasted for about two days during which the source spectrum was modelled by a simple power law, and a pulsed signal was still detectable in the 15-100 keV energy range.

	abstract = {The accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) SAX J1808.4-3658, shows a peculiar orbital evolution that proceeds at a much faster pace than predicted by conservative binary evolution models. It is important to identify the underlying mechanism responsible for this behavior because it can help to understand how this system evolves. It has also been suggested that, when in quiescence, SAX J1808.4-3658 turns on as a radio pulsar, a circumstance that might provide a link between AMXPs and black-widow radio pulsars. In this work we report the results of a deep radio pulsation search at 2 GHz using the Green Bank Telescope in August 2014 and an X-ray monitoring of the 2015 outburst with Chandra, Swift, and INTEGRAL. In particular, we present the X-ray timing analysis of a 30-ks Chandra observation executed during the 2015 outburst. We detect no radio pulsations, and place the strongest limit to date on the pulsed radio flux density of any AMXP. We also find that the orbit of SAX J1808.4-3658 continues evolving at a fast pace and we compare it to the bhevior of other accreting and non-accreting binaries. We discuss two scenarios: either the neutron star has a large moment of inertia (I>1.7x10^45 g cm^2) and is ablating the donor (by using its spin-down power) thus generating mass-loss with an efficiency of 40% or the donor star is undergoing quasi-cyclic variations due to a varying mass-quadrupole induced by either a strong (1 kG) field or by some unidentified mechanism probably linked to irradiation.},

	abstract = {The persistent Be/X-ray binary RX J0440.9 + 4431 flared in 2010 and 2011 and has been followed by various X-ray facilities (Swift, RXTE, XMM-Newton, and INTEGRAL). We studied the source timing and spectral properties as a function of its X-ray luminosity to investigate the transition from normal to flaring activity and the dynamical properties of the system. We have determined the orbital period from the long-term Swift/BAT light curve, but our determinations of the spin-period are not precise enough to constrain any orbital solution. The source spectrum can always be described by a bulk-motion Comptonization model of black body seed photons attenuated by a moderate photoelectric absorption. At the highest luminosity, we measured a curvature of the spectrum, which we attribute to a significant contribution of the radiation pressure in the accretion process. This allows us to estimate that the transition from a bulk-motion-dominated flow to a radiatively dominated one happens at a luminosity of ~2 × 1036 erg s-1. The luminosity dependency of the size of the black body emission region is found to be rBB ∝ LX0.39$\pm$0.02 . This suggests that either matter accreting onto the neutron star hosted in RX J0440.9 + 4431 penetrates through closed magnetic field lines at the border of the compact object magnetosphere or that the structure of the neutron star magnetic field is more complicated than a simple dipole close to the surface.},

	abstract = {Many techniques for measuring neutron star radii rely on absolute flux measurements in the X-rays. As a result, one of the fundamental uncertainties in these spectroscopic measurements arises from the absolute flux calibrations of the detectors being used. Using the stable X-ray burster, GS 1826-238, and its simultaneous observations by Chandra HETG/ACIS-S and RXTE/PCA as well as by XMM-Newton EPIC-pn and RXTE/PCA, we quantify the degree of uncertainty in the flux calibration by assessing the differences between the measured fluxes during bursts. We find that the RXTE/PCA and the Chandra gratings measurements agree with each other within their formal uncertainties, increasing our confidence in these flux measurements. In contrast, XMM-Newton EPIC-pn measures 14.0 $\pm$ 0.3% less flux than the RXTE/PCA. This is consistent with the previously reported discrepancy with the flux measurements of EPIC-pn, compared with EPIC MOS1, MOS2, and ACIS-S detectors. We also show that any intrinsic time-dependent systematic uncertainty that may exist in the calibration of the satellites has already been implicity taken into account in the neutron star radius measurements.},

	abstract = {We present the high-resolution spectrum of the accretion-powered millisecond pulsar XTE J0929-314 during its 2002 outburst, measured using the Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer on board the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. The 1.5-25.3 {\AA} (0.5-8.3 keV) Chandra spectrum is well fitted by a power-law+blackbody model with photon index Gamma=1.55+/-0.03, blackbody temperature kTbb=0.65+/-0.03 keV, and blackbody normalization Rbb,km/d10kpc=7.6+/-0.8. No emission or absorption features are found in the high-resolution spectrum, with a 3 sigma equivalent width upper limit of less than 0.007 {\AA} at 1.5 {\AA} and less than 0.12 {\AA} at 24 {\AA}. The neutral absorption edge depths are consistent with the estimated interstellar absorption along the line of sight to the source. We found no orbital modulation of the 2-10 keV X-ray flux, to a 3 sigma upper limit of 1.1%, which implies an upper limit on the binary inclination angle of i<~85deg for a Roche lobe-filling companion. We also present the broadband spectrum measured over the course of the outburst by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The RXTE spectrum of XTE J0929-314 is also well fitted with a power-law+blackbody model, with average values of Gamma=1.76+/-0.03, kTbb=0.66+/-0.06 keV, and Rbb,km/d10kpc=5.9+/-1.3 in the 2-50 keV energy range. The blackbody flux remained constant over the course of the outburst, while the power-law flux was strongly correlated to the (decreasing) flux of the source. We find that the difference in power-law photon indices measured from Chandra and RXTE spectra can be explained by a change in the power-law photon index at low energies.},

	abstract = {Aims: We review some aspects of the theory of magnetic threaded disks. Methods: We discuss in particular the equations that determine the position of the inner disk boundary by using different prescriptions for the neutron star-accretion disk interaction. We apply the results to several accretion powered X-ray pulsars that show both quasi-periodic oscillations in their X-ray flux and spin-up/spin-down torque reversals. Under the hypothesis that the beat-frequency model is applicable to the quasi-periodic oscillations, we show that these sources provide an excellent opportunity to test models of the disk-magnetosphere interaction.  Results: A comparison is carried out between the magnetospheric radius obtained with all the prescriptions used in threaded disk models; this shows that none of those prescriptions is able to reproduce the combination of quasi-periodic oscillations and torque behaviour observed for different X-ray luminosity levels in the X-ray pulsars in the present sample.  Conclusions: This suggests that the problem of accretion disk threading by stellar magnetic field still lacks a comprehensive solution. We briefly discuss an outline of possible future developments in this field.},

	abstract = {We report on INTEGRAL, Swift and XMM-Newton observations of IGR J17511-3057 performed during the outburst that occurred between March 23 and April 25, 2015. The source reached a peak flux of 0.7(2)E-9 erg/cm$^2$/s and decayed to quiescence in approximately a month. The X-ray spectrum was dominated by a power-law with photon index between 1.6 and 1.8, which we interpreted as thermal Comptonization in an electron cloud with temperature > 20 keV . A broad ({\sigma} ~ 1 keV) emission line was detected at an energy (E = 6.9$^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ keV) compatible with the K{\alpha} transition of ionized Fe, suggesting an origin in the inner regions of the accretion disk. The outburst flux and spectral properties shown during this outburst were remarkably similar to those observed during the previous accretion event detected from the source in 2009. Coherent pulsations at the pulsar spin period were detected in the XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL data, at a frequency compatible with the value observed in 2009. Assuming that the source spun up during the 2015 outburst at the same rate observed during the previous outburst, we derive a conservative upper limit on the spin down rate during quiescence of 3.5E-15 Hz/s. Interpreting this value in terms of electromagnetic spin down yields an upper limit of 3.6E26 G/cm$^3$ to the pulsar magnetic dipole (assuming a magnetic inclination angle of 30{\deg}). We also report on the detection of five type-I X-ray bursts (three in the XMM-Newton data, two in the INTEGRAL data), none of which indicated photospheric radius expansion.},

	abstract = {During an outburst from the transient, 42 s, X-ray pulsar EXO 2030+375, marked luminosity-dependent changes in pulsar profile were observed. At high luminosities the pulse profile consisted of a smooth asymmetric main pulse separated by about 180 deg in phase from a small interpulse. As the luminosity decreased by a factor of about 100, the relative strength of the two pulses reversed. During a second outburst, the phase-averaged X-ray light curve was punctuated by a series of flares that repeated about every four hours and involved a factor of six increase in intensity. The observed pulse profile is modeled using a simple geometric model where axially symmetric fan and pencil-beams of emission are emitted from two magnetic poles on a rotating neutron star. The profile shows a marked asymmetry which is modeled by offsetting the magnetic dipole axis from the rotation axis of the neutron star. The modeling indicates that, as the luminosity decreased, the dominant beam changed from a fan beam to a pencil-beam configuration.},

	abstract = {We report on the first 180 days of Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer observations of the outburst of the black hole candidate IGR J17091-3624. This source exhibits a broad variety of complex light curve patterns including periods of strong flares alternating with quiet intervals. Similar patterns in the X-ray light curves have been seen in the (up to now) unique black hole system GRS 1915+105. In the context of the variability classes defined by Belloni et al. for GRS 1915+105, we find that IGR J17091-3624 shows the nu, rho, alpha, lambda, beta, and mu classes as well as quiet periods which resemble the chi class, all occurring at 2-60 keV count rate levels which can be 10-50 times lower than observed in GRS 1915+105. The so-called rho class "heartbeats" occur as fast as every few seconds and as slow as ~100 s, tracing a loop in the hardness-intensity diagram which resembles that previously seen in GRS 1915+105. However, while GRS 1915+105 traverses this loop clockwise, IGR J17091-3624 does so in the opposite sense. We briefly discuss our findings in the context of the models proposed for GRS 1915+105 and find that either all models requiring near Eddington luminosities for GRS 1915+105-like variability fail, or IGR J17091-3624 lies at a distance well in excess of 20 kpc, or it harbors one of the least massive black holes known (<3 M &sun;).},

	abstract = {Iron emission and absorption features from nine X-ray binaries are compared with a model that predicts characteristics of iron K-shell features corresponding to different viewing angles for the accretion disk. In this model, emission and absorption features arise from an accretion disk corona whose structure is computed under the assumptions of ionization, thermal, and hydrostatic balance of gas illuminated by the central continuum source. Hence the equivalent widths of the emission and absorption features are predicted without the introduction of any free parameters to control the physical conditions in the disk corona. Our data/model comparison suggests an explanation for the equivalent widths of the iron K-alpha emission and the depth of the absorption edge in terms of (1) the angle of inclination between the observer's line of sight and the plane of the accretion disk and (2) the shape of the incident source spectrum.},

A simplified model for an accretion disk corona is used to examine the dependence of the observable line properties, line width and mean energy, on the radial distance of the emission region from the X-ray source, and on the fraction of the X-rays from the source which reach the disk surface. The effects of blending of multiple line components and of Comptonization of the line profile are included in numerical calculations of the emitted profile shape. The results of these calculations, when compared with the line properties observed from several low-mass X-ray binaries, suggest that the broadening is dominated either by rotation or by Compton scattering through a greater optical depth than is expected from an accretion disk corona.},

@article{Laurent2007a,
	abstract = {In an earlier paper, the general formulation and results for photon reprocessing (downscattering) that included recoil and Comptonization effects due to divergence of the flow were presented. In a second paper we showed the Monte Carlo (MC) simulated continuum and line spectra. We also provided an analytical description of the simulated continuum spectra using the diffusion approximation. We have simulated the propagation of monochromatic and continuum photons in a bulk outflow from a compact object. Electron scattering of the photons within the expanding flow leads to a decrease of their energy, which is of first order in V/c (where V is the outflow velocity). The downscattering effect of first order in V/c in the diverging flow is explained by semianalytical calculations and confirmed by MC simulations. We conclude that redshifted lines and downscattering bumps are intrinsic properties of the powerful outflows for which the Thomson optical depth is greater than 1. We fitted our model line profiles to the observations using four free parameters, beta=V/c, the optical depth of the wind tau, the wind temperature kTe, and the original line photon energy E0. We show how the primary spectrum emitted close to the black hole is modified by reprocessing in the warm wind. In the framework of our wind model, the fluorescent iron line Kalpha is formed in the partly ionized wind as a result of illumination by central source continuum photons. The demonstrated application of our outflow model to the XMM-Newton observations of MCG -6-30-15 and to the ASCA observations of GRO J1655-40 points out a potential powerful spectral diagnostic for probes of the outflow-central object connection in Galactic and extragalactic black hole sources.},

	abstract = {We show that discs accreting on to the magnetosphere of a rotating star can end up in a trapped state, in which the inner edge of the disc stays near the corotation radius, even at low and varying accretion rates. The accretion in these trapped states can be steady or cyclic; we explore these states over a wide range of parameter space. We find two distinct regions of instability: one related to the buildup and release of mass in the disc outside corotation, and the other to mass storage within the transition region near corotation. With a set of calculations over long time-scales, we show how trapped states evolve from both non-accreting and fully accreting initial conditions, and also calculate the effects of cyclic accretion on the spin evolution of the star. Observations of cycles such as found here would provide important clues on the physics of magnetospheric accretion. Recent observations of cyclic and other unusual variability in T Tauri stars (EXors) and X-ray binaries are discussed in this context.},

@article{DAngelo2011a,
	abstract = {We investigate the evolution of a thin viscous disc surrounding a magnetic star, including the spin-down of the star by the magnetic torques it exerts on the disc. The transition from an accreting to a non-accreting state, and the change of the magnetic torque across the corotation radius rc are included in a generic way, the widths of the transition taken in the range suggested by numerical simulations. In addition to the standard accreting state, in which the star gradually moves into spin equilibrium with the disc, two more states are found. An accreting state can develop into a 'dead' disc state, with inner edge rin well outside corotation. More often, a 'trapped' state develops, in which rin stays close to corotation even at very low accretion rates. The long-term evolution of these two states is different. In the dead state the star spins down incompletely, retaining much of its initial spin. In the trapped state the star can asymptotically spin-down to arbitrarily low rates, with its angular momentum transferred to the disc. We identify these outcomes with respectively the rapidly rotating and the very slowly rotating classes of Ap stars and magnetic white dwarfs.},

It was found to be active in August, 1998, with the Wide Field Camera and the narrow field instruments on the BeppoSAX spacecraft, and with the All-Sky Monitor and the Proportional Counter Array on the RossiXTE spacecraft. Four X-ray bursts were detected, at least one of which shows the characteristics of a thermonuclear flash on a neutron star, in analogy with some ~ 20 optically identified low-mass X-ray binaries. The broad-band spectrum is hard as is common among low-mass X-ray binaries of lower luminosity (la10 (37) erg s(-1) ) and can be explained by a Comptonized model. During the burst the >30 keV emission brightened, consistent with part of the burst emission being Compton up scattered within ~ 10(11) cm.},

@article{Hartman2011a,
	abstract = {The accretion-powered millisecond pulsar IGR J00291+5934 underwent two ~10 day long outbursts during 2008, separated by 30 days in quiescence. Such a short quiescent period between outbursts has never been seen before from a neutron star X-ray transient. X-ray pulsations at the 599 Hz spin frequency are detected throughout both outbursts. For the first time, we derive a pulse phase model that connects two outbursts, providing a long baseline for spin frequency measurement. Comparison with the frequency measured during the 2004 outburst of this source gives a spin-down during quiescence of -(4 $\pm$ 1) × 10-15 Hz s-1, approximately an order of magnitude larger than the long-term spin-down observed in the 401 Hz accretion-powered pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. If this spin-down is due to magnetic dipole radiation, it requires a 2 × 108 G field strength, and its high spin-down luminosity may be detectable with the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Alternatively, this large spin-down could be produced by gravitational wave emission from a fractional mass quadrupole moment of Q/I = 1 × 10-9. The rapid succession of the outbursts also provides a unique test of models for accretion in low-mass X-ray binaries. Disk instability models generally predict that an outburst will leave the accretion disk too depleted to fuel a second outburst after such a brief quiescence. We suggest a modification in which the outburst is shut off by the onset of a propeller effect before the disk is depleted. This model can explain the short quiescence and the unusually slow rise of the light curve of the second 2008 outburst.},

@article{Bachetti2014a,
	abstract = {The majority of ultraluminous X-ray sources are point sources that are spatially offset from the nuclei of nearby galaxies and whose X-ray luminosities exceed the theoretical maximum for spherical infall (the Eddington limit) onto stellar-mass black holes. Their X-ray luminosities in the 0.5-10 kiloelectronvolt energy band range from 1039 to 1041 ergs per second. Because higher masses imply less extreme ratios of the luminosity to the isotropic Eddington limit, theoretical models have focused on black hole rather than neutron star systems. The most challenging sources to explain are those at the luminous end of the range (more than 1040 ergs per second), which require black hole masses of 50-100 times the solar value or significant departures from the standard thin disk accretion that powers bright Galactic X-ray binaries, or both. Here we report broadband X-ray observations of the nuclear region of the galaxy M82 that reveal pulsations with an average period of 1.37 seconds and a 2.5-day sinusoidal modulation. The pulsations result from the rotation of a magnetized neutron star, and the modulation arises from its binary orbit. The pulsed flux alone corresponds to an X-ray luminosity in the 3-30 kiloelectronvolt range of 4.9 × 1039 ergs per second. The pulsating source is spatially coincident with a variable source that can reach an X-ray luminosity in the 0.3-10 kiloelectronvolt range of 1.8 × 1040 ergs per second. This association implies a luminosity of about 100 times the Eddington limit for a 1.4-solar-mass object, or more than ten times brighter than any known accreting pulsar. This implies that neutron stars may not be rare in the ultraluminous X-ray population, and it challenges physical models for the accretion of matter onto magnetized compact objects.},

@article{Poutanen2007a,
	abstract = {We derive the luminosity-temperature relation for the supercritically accreting black holes (BHs) and compare it to the data on ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). At super-Eddington accretion rates, an outflow forms within the spherization radius. We construct the accretion disc model accounting for the advection and the outflow, and compute characteristic disc temperatures. The bolometric luminosity exceeds the Eddington luminosity LEdd by a logarithmic factor (where is the accretion rate in Eddington units) and the wind kinetic luminosity is close to LEdd. The apparent luminosity for the face-on observer is 2-7 times higher because of geometrical beaming. Such an observer has a direct view of the inner hot accretion disc, which has a peak temperature Tmax of a few keV in stellar mass BHs. The emitted spectrum extends as a power law FE ~ E-1 down to the temperature at the spherization radius . We associate Tmax with a few keV spectral components and Tsp with the soft, 0.1-0.2 keV components observed in ULXs. An edge-on observer sees only the soft emission from the extended envelope, with the photosphere radius exceeding the spherization radius by orders of magnitude. The dependence of the photosphere temperature on luminosity is consistent with that observed in the super-Eddington accreting BHs SS 433 and V4641 Sgr. Strong outflows combined with the large intrinsic X-ray luminosity of the central BH explain naturally the presence of the photoionized nebulae around ULXs. An excellent agreement between the model and the observational data strongly argues in favour of ULXs being supercritically accreting, stellar mass BHs similar to SS 433, but viewed close to the symmetric axis.},

@article{Neilsen2012a,
	abstract = {We present a unifying scenario to address the physical origin of the diversity of X-ray light curves within the rho variability class of the microquasar GRS 1915+105. This "heartbeat" state is characterized by a bright flare that recurs every ~50-100 s, but the profile and duration of the flares vary significantly from observation to observation. Based on a comprehensive, phase-resolved study of heartbeats in the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer archive, we demonstrate that very different X-ray light curves do not require origins in different accretion processes. Indeed, our detailed comparison of the phase-resolved spectra of a double-peaked oscillation and a single-peaked oscillation shows that different cycles can have basically similar X-ray spectral evolution. We argue that all heartbeat oscillations can be understood as the result of a combination of a thermal-viscous radiation pressure instability, a local Eddington limit in the disk, and a sudden, radiation-pressure-driven evaporation or ejection event in the inner accretion disk. This ejection appears to be a universal, fundamental part of the rho state, and is largely responsible for a hard X-ray pulse seen in the light curve of all cycles. We suggest that the detailed shape of oscillations in the mass accretion rate through the disk is responsible for the phenomenological differences between different rho-type light curves, and we discuss how future time-dependent simulations of disk instabilities may provide new insights into the role of radiation pressure in the accretion flow.},

@article{Bachetti2015a,
	abstract = {Timing of high-count-rate sources with the NuSTAR Small Explorer Mission requires specialized analysis techniques. NuSTAR was primarily designed for spectroscopic observations of sources with relatively low count rates rather than for timing analysis of bright objects. The instrumental dead time per event is relatively long (~2.5 msec) and varies event-to-event by a few percent. The most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noise level in the power density spectrum (PDS) that cannot be easily modeled with standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time. In this paper, we show that it is possible to exploit the presence of two completely independent focal planes and use the cospectrum, the real part of the cross PDS, to obtain a good proxy of the white-noise-subtracted PDS. Thereafter, one can use a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the remaining effects of dead time, namely, a frequency-dependent modulation of the variance and a frequency-independent drop of the sensitivity to variability. In this way, most of the standard timing analysis can be performed, albeit with a sacrifice in signal-to-noise ratio relative to what would be achieved using more standard techniques. We apply this technique to NuSTAR observations of the black hole binaries GX 339-4, Cyg X-1, and GRS 1915+105.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a broad-band spectral study of the transient low-mass X-ray binary Aql X-1 observed by the Suzaku and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellites. The source was observed during its 2007 outburst in the high/soft (Banana) state and in the low/hard (Extreme Island) state. Both the Banana state and the Extreme Island state spectra are best described by a two-component model consisting of a soft multicolour blackbody emission likely originating from the accretion disc and a harder Comptonized emission from the boundary layer. Evidence for a hard tail (extending to ˜50 keV) is found during the Banana state; this further (transient) component, accounting for at least ˜1.5 per cent of the source luminosity, is modelled by a power law. Aql X-1 is the second Atoll source after GX 13+1 to show a high-energy tail. The presence of a weak but broad Fe line provides further support for a standard accretion disc extending nearly to the neutron star surface. The input photons for the Comptonizing boundary layer could be either the disc photons or the hidden surface of the star or both. The luminosity of the boundary layer is similar to the disc luminosity in the Banana state and is about six times larger in the Extreme Island state. The temperature of the Comptonizing boundary layer changes from ˜2 keV in the Banana state to ˜20 keV in the Extreme Island state.},

	abstract = {We present NuSTAR and Swift observations of the neutron star Aquila X-1 during the peak of its 2014 July outburst. The spectrum is soft with strong evidence for a broad Fe Kalpha line. Modeled with a relativistically broadened reflection model, we find that the inner disk is truncated with an inner radius of 15+/- 3{R}G. The disk is likely truncated by either the boundary layer and/or a magnetic field. Associating the truncated inner disk with pressure from a magnetic field gives an upper limit of B\lt 5+/- 2× {10}8 G. Although the radius is truncated far from the stellar surface, material is still reaching the neutron star surface as evidenced by the X-ray burst present in the NuSTAR observation.},

In Sections 2-3, we detail the methods which the Swift-XRT team has developed to produce the enhanced positions, light curves, hardness ratios and spectra presented in this paper. Software using these methods continues to create such products for all new GRBs observed by the Swift-XRT. We also detail web-based tools allowing users to create these products for any object observed by the XRT, not just GRBs. In Sections 4-6, we present the results of our analysis of GRBs, including probability distribution functions of the temporal and spectral properties of the sample. We demonstrate evidence for a consistent underlying behaviour which can produce a range of light-curve morphologies, and attempt to interpret this behaviour in the framework of external forward shock emission. We find several difficulties, in particular that reconciliation of our data with the forward shock model requires energy injection to continue for days to weeks.},

@article{Gambino2016a,
	abstract = {Context. 4U 1323-619 is a low mass X-ray binary system that shows type I X-ray bursts and dips. The most accurate estimation of the orbital period is 2.941923(36) h and a distance from the source that is lower than 11 kpc has been proposed.  Aims: We aim to obtain the orbital ephemeris, the orbital period of the system, as well as its derivative to compare the observed luminosity with that predicted by the theory of secular evolution.  Methods: We took the advantage of about 26 yrs of X-ray data and grouped the selected observations when close in time. We folded the light curves and used the timing technique, obtaining 12 dip arrival times. We fit the delays of the dip arrival times both with a linear and a quadratic function.  Results: We locate 4U 1323-619 within a circular area centred at RA (J2000) = 201.6543$\,^{\circ}$ and Dec (J2000) = -62.1358$\,^{\circ}$ with an associated error of 0.0002$\,^{\circ}$, and confirm the detection of the IR counterpart already discussed in literature. We estimate an orbital period of P = 2.9419156(6) h compatible with the estimations that are present in the literature, but with an accuracy ten times higher. We also obtain a constraint on the orbital period derivative for the first time, estimating P = (8 $\pm$ 13) × 10-12 s/s. Assuming that the companion star is in thermal equilibrium in the lower main sequence, and is a neutron star of 1.4 M&sun;, we infer a mass of 0.28 $\pm$ 0.03 M&sun; for the companion star. Assuming a distance of 10 kpc, we obtained a luminosity of (4.3 $\pm$ 0.5) × 1036 erg s-1, which is not in agreement with what is predicted by the theory of secular evolution. Using a 3D extinction map of the Ks radiation in our Galaxy, we obtain a distance of 4.2+0.8-0.7 kpc at 68% confidence level. This distance implies a luminosity estimation of (0.8 $\pm$ 0.3) × 1036 erg s-1, which is consistent with the adopted scenario in which the companion star is in thermal equilibrium.},

	abstract = {We obtained R- and I-band CCD photometry of the soft X-ray transient/neutron-star binary Aql X-1 in 1998 June while it was at quiescence. We find that its light curve is dominated by ellipsoidal variations, although the ellipsoidal variations are severely distorted and have unequal maxima. After we correct for the contaminating flux from a field star located only 0.46" away, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the modulation is ~0.25 mag in the R band, which requires the orbital inclination to be greater than 36$\,^{\circ}$. The orbital period we measure is consistent with the 18.95 hr period measured by Chevalier & Ilovaisky. During its outbursts the light curve of Aql X-1 becomes single-humped. The outburst light curve observed by Garcia et al. agrees in phase with our quiescent light curve. We show that the single-humped variation is caused by a ``reflection effect,'' that is, by heating of the side of the secondary star facing toward the neutron star.},

The GSC employs large-area position-sensitive proportional counters with a total detector area of 5350 cm-2. The on-board data processor has functions to format telemetry data as well as to control the high voltage of the proportional counters so as to protect them from particle irradiation. This paper describes the instruments, on-board data processing, telemetry data formats, and performance specifications expected from ground calibration tests.},

	abstract = {he burst alert telescope (BAT) is one of three instruments on the Swift MIDEX spacecraft to study gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The BAT first detects the GRB and localizes the burst direction to an accuracy of 1 4 arcmin within 20 s after the start of the event. The GRB trigger initiates an autonomous spacecraft slew to point the two narrow field-of-view (FOV) instruments at the burst location within 20 70 s so to make follow-up X-ray and optical observations. The BAT is a wide-FOV, coded-aperture instrument with a CdZnTe detector plane. The detector plane is composed of 32,768 pieces of CdZnTe (4×4×2 mm), and the coded-aperture mask is composed of ˜52,000 pieces of lead (5×5×1 mm) with a 1-m separation between mask and detector plane. The BAT operates over the 15 150 keV energy range with ˜7 keV resolution, a sensitivity of ˜10-8 erg s-1 cm-2, and a 1.4 sr (half-coded) FOV. We expect to detect > 100 GRBs/year for a 2-year mission. The BAT also performs an all-sky hard X-ray survey with a sensitivity of ˜2 m Crab (systematic limit) and it serves as a hard X-ray transient monitor.},

	abstract = {Very faint X-ray binaries appear to be transient in many cases with peak luminosities much fainter than that of usual soft X-ray transients, but their nature still remains elusive. We investigate the possibility that this transient behaviour is due to the same thermal/viscous instability which is responsible for outbursts of bright soft X-ray transients, occurring in ultracompact binaries for adequately low mass-transfer rates. More generally, we investigate the observational consequences of this instability when it occurs in ultracompact binaries. We use our code for modelling the thermal-viscous instability of the accretion disc, assumed here to be hydrogen poor. We also take into account the effects of disc X-ray irradiation, and consider the impact of the mass-transfer rate on the outburst brightness. We find that one can reproduce the observed properties of both the very faint and the brighter short transients (peak luminosity, duration, recurrence times), provided that the viscosity parameter in quiescence is slightly smaller (typically a factor of between two and four) than in bright soft X-ray transients and normal dwarf nova outbursts, the viscosity in outburst being unchanged. This possibly reflects the impact of chemical composition on non-ideal MHD effects affecting magnetically driven turbulence in poorly ionized discs.},

	abstract = {PSR J1023+0038 (J1023) is a binary system hosting a neutron star and a low mass companion. J1023 is the best studied transitional pulsar, alternating a faint eclipsing millisecond radio pulsar state to a brighter X-ray active state. At variance with other Low Mass X-ray binaries, this active state reaches luminosities of only ~$10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, showing strong, fast variability. In the active state, J1023 displays: i) a high state ($L_X\sim7\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$, 0.3-80 keV) occurring ~80% of the time and during which X-ray pulsations at the neutron star spin period are detected (pulsed fraction ~8%); ii) a low state ($L_X~10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$) during which pulsations are not detected (~<3%); and iii) a flaring state during which sporadic flares occur in excess of ~$10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with no pulsation too. The transition between the high and the low states is very rapid, on a ~10 s timescale. Here we put forward a plausible physical interpretation of the high and low states based on the (fast) transition among the propeller state and the radio pulsar state. We modelled the XMM-Newton spectra of the high, low and radio pulsar states, finding a good agreement with this physical picture.},

@article{Watkins2015a,
	abstract = {We present dynamical distance estimates for 15 Galactic globular clusters (GCs) and use these to check the consistency of dynamical and photometric distance estimates. For most of the clusters, this is the first dynamical distance estimate ever determined. We extract proper-motion (PM) dispersion profiles using cleaned samples of bright stars from the Hubble Space Telescope PM catalogs recently presented in Bellini et al. and compile a set of line of sight (LOS) velocity-dispersion profiles from a variety of literature sources. Distances are then estimated by fitting spherical, non-rotating, isotropic, constant mass-to-light ratio (M/L) dynamical models to the PM and LOS dispersion profiles together. We compare our dynamical distance estimates with literature photometric estimates from the Harris GC catalog and find that the mean fractional difference between the two types is consistent with zero at just -1.9 $\pm$ 1.7%. This indicates that there are no significant biases in either estimation method and provides an important validation of the stellar-evolution theory that underlies photometric distance estimates. The analysis also estimates dynamical M/Ls for our clusters; on average, the dynamically inferred M/Ls agree with existing stellar-population-based M/Ls that assume a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF) to within -8.8 $\pm$ 6.4%, implying that such an IMF is consistent with our data. Our results are also consistent with a Kroupa IMF, but strongly rule out a Salpeter IMF. We detect no correlation between our M/L offsets from literature values and our distance offsets from literature values, strongly indicating that our methods are reliable and our results are robust.  Based on proprietary and archival observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

The angular resolution of the combined material is HPBW ~ 0.6deg. The LSR velocity coverage spans the interval -450 km s-1 to +400 km s-1, at a resolution of 1.3 km s-1. The data were corrected for stray radiation at the Institute for Radioastronomy of the University of Bonn, refining the original correction applied to the LDS. The rms brightness-temperature noise of the merged database is 0.07-0.09 K. Residual errors in the profile wings due to defects in the correction for stray radiation are for most of the data below a level of 20-40 mK. It would be necessary to construct a telescope with a main beam efficiency of etaMB ⪆ 99% to achieve the same accuracy. The merged and refined material entering the LAB Survey of Galactic H i is intended to be a general resource useful to a wide range of studies of the physical and structural characteristices of the Galactic interstellar environment. The LAB Survey is the most sensitive Milky Way H i survey to date, with the most extensive coverage both spatially and kinematically.},

	abstract = {We have undertaken an extensive study of X-ray data from the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1751-305 observed by RXTE and XMM-Newton during its 2002 outburst. In all aspects this source is similar to the prototypical millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658, except for the higher peak luminosity of 13 per cent of Eddington, and the optical depth of the hard X-ray source, which is larger by a factor ~2. Its broad-band X-ray spectrum can be modelled by three components. We interpret the two soft components as thermal emission from a colder (kT~ 0.6 keV) accretion disc and a hotter (~1 keV) spot on the neutron star surface. We interpret the hard component as thermal Comptonization in plasma of temperature ~40 keV and optical depth ~1.5 in a slab geometry. The plasma is heated by the accretion shock as the material collimated by the magnetic field impacts on to the surface. The seed photons for Comptonization are provided by the hotspot, not by the disc. The Compton reflection is weak and the disc is probably truncated into an optically thin flow above the magnetospheric radius. Rotation of the emission region with the star creates an almost sinusoidal pulse profile with an rms amplitude of 3.3 per cent. The energy-dependent soft phase lags can be modelled by two pulsating components shifted in phase, which is naturally explained by a different character of emission of the optically thick spot and optically thin shock combined with the action of the Doppler boosting. The observed variability amplitude constrains the hotspot to lie within 3$\,^{\circ}$-4$\,^{\circ}$ of the rotational pole. We estimate the inner radius of the optically thick accreting disc to be about 40 km. In that case, the absence of emission from the antipodal spot, which can be blocked by the accretion disc, gives the inclination of the system as >~70$\,^{\circ}$.},

	abstract = {We discuss the mass-radius (M-R) relations for low-mass (M<0.1Msolar) white dwarfs (WDs) of arbitrary degeneracy and evolved (He, C, O) composition. We do so with both a simple analytical model and models calculated by integration of hydrostatic balance using a modern equation of state valid for fully ionized plasmas. The M-R plane is divided into three regions where either Coulomb physics, degenerate electrons, or a classical gas dominates the WD structure. For a given M and central temperature Tc, the M-R relation has two branches differentiated by the model's entropy content. We present the M-R relations for a sequence of constant-entropy WDs of arbitrary degeneracy parameterized by M and Tc for pure He, C, and O. We discuss the applications of these models to the recently discovered accreting millisecond pulsars. We show the relationship between the orbital inclination for these binaries and the donor's composition and Tc. In particular, we find from orbital inclination constraints that the probability XTE J1807-294 can accommodate a He donor is approximately 15%, while for XTE J0929-304 it is approximately 35%. We argue that if the donors in ultracompact systems evolve adiabatically, there should be 60-160 more systems at orbital periods of 40 minutes than at orbital periods of 10 minutes, depending on the donor's composition. Tracks of our mass-radius relations for He, C, and O objects are available in the electronic version of this paper.},

We considered masses from 0.15 Msun  to 0.5 Msun  for the case of helium core, from 0.45 Msun  to 1.2 Msun  for carbon, oxygen and silicon cores, and from 0.45 Msun  to 1.0 Msun  for the case of an iron core. In view of the recent measurements made by Hipparcos that strongly suggest the existence of WDs with an iron-dominated core, we focus our attention mainly on the finite-temperature, mass-radius relations for WD models with iron interiors. In addition, we explore the effects of gravitational, chemical and thermal diffusion on low mass helium white dwarf models with hydrogen and helium envelopes.},

	abstract = {The presence of a white dwarf in a resolved binary system, such as Sirius, provides an opportunity to combine dynamical information about the masses, from astrometry and spectroscopy, with a gravitational red-shift measurement and spectrophotometry of the white dwarf atmosphere to provide a test of theoretical mass-radius relations of unprecedented accuracy. We demonstrated this with the first Balmer line spectrum of Sirius B to be obtained free of contamination from the primary, with STIS on HST. However, we also found an unexplained discrepancy between the spectroscopic and gravitational red-shift mass determinations. With the recovery of STIS, we have been able to revisit our observations of Sirius B with an improved observation strategy designed to reduce systematic errors on the gravitational red-shift measurement. We provide a preliminary report on the refined precision of the Sirius B mass-radius measurements and the extension of this technique to a larger sample of white dwarfs in resolved binaries. Together these data can provide accurate mass and radius determinations capable of testing the theoretical mass-radius relation and distinguishing between possible structural models.},

	abstract = {Recent literature has seen an ongoing discussion on the limiting mass of strongly magnetized white dwarfs, since such objects may prove to be a source of overluminous Type-Ia supernovae. In an earlier paper, we have presented the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs with a strong poloidal magnetic field in Newtonian gravity. The inclusion of effects such as general relativistic gravity and many-body corrections to the equation of state can alter the mass-radius relation and the maximum mass. In this work we estimate the extent to which these effects may modify the earlier results. We find that the general relativistic effects tend to reduce the maximum mass by about 2 per cent and many-body corrections by another additional ˜2 per cent, for an assumed carbon composition. We also explore field geometries that are purely toroidal or a mixture of poloidal and toroidal and find that the limiting mass of such equilibrium configurations can be substantially higher than in the case of a purely poloidal field.},

Overall, our results support the predictions of the white dwarf mass-radius relation and our understanding of stellar degeneracy. Our most important finding for an individual object is the position of 40 Eri B, a well-known puzzle, now consistent with single-star evolution.

@article{Massari2016a,
	abstract = {Context. Globular clusters are the oldest stellar systems in the Milky Way, and they probe the early epoch of the Galaxy formation. However, the uncertainties on their absolute age are still too large to soundly constrain how the Galactic structures have assembled.  Aims: The aim of this work is to obtain an accurate estimate of the absolute age of the globular cluster NGC 2808 using deep IR data obtained with the multi-conjugate adaptive optics system operating at the Gemini South telescope (GeMS).  Methods: This exquisite photometry, combined with that obtained in V and I-bands with HST, allowed us to detect the faint Main Sequence Knee feature in NGC 2808 colour magnitude diagram. The difference between this point and the main sequence turn-off is a good age estimator that provides ages with unprecedented accuracy.  Results: We find that NGC 2808 has an age of t = 10.9 $\pm$ 0.7 (intrinsic) $\pm$0.45 (metallicity term) Gyr. A possible contamination by He-enhanced population could make the cluster up to 0.25 Gyr older. Although this age estimate agrees with the age coming from the classical turn-off method (t = 11.0 Gyr), its uncertainty is a factor ~3 better, since it avoids systematics in reddening, distance assumptions, and photometric zero point determination. The final absolute age indicates that NGC 2808 is slightly younger than other Galactic globular clusters with similar metallicity.

@article{Bildsten2001a,
	abstract = {The BeppoSAX Wide Field Cameras have revealed a population of faint neutron star X-ray transients in the Galactic bulge. King conjectured that these neutron stars are accreting from brown dwarfs with a time-averaged mass transfer rate <M>~10-11 Msolar yr-1 that is low enough for accretion disk instabilities. We show that the measured orbital parameters of the 401 Hz accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 support this hypothesis. A main-sequence mass donor requires a nearly face-on inclination and a higher <M> than observed, and can thus be excluded. However, the range of allowed inclinations is substantially relaxed, and the predicted <M> is consistent with that observed if a hot 0.05 Msolar dwarf is the donor. The remaining puzzle is explaining the brown dwarf radius required (0.13 Rsolar) to fill the Roche lobe. Recent observational and theoretical work has shown that all transiently accreting neutron stars have a minimum luminosity in quiescence set by the time-averaged mass transfer rate onto the neutron star. We show here that the constant heating of the brown dwarf by this quiescent neutron star emission appears adequate to maintain the higher entropy implied by a 0.13 Rsolar radius. All of our considerations very strongly bolster the case that SAX J1808.4-3658 is a progenitor to compact millisecond radio pulsar binaries (e.g., like those found by Camilo and collaborators in 47 Tuc). The very low <M> of SAX J1808.4-3658 implies that the progenitors to these radio pulsars are long-lived (~Gyr) transient systems, rather than short-lived (~Myr) Eddington-limited accretors. Hence, the accreting progenitor population to millisecond radio pulsars in 47 Tuc could still be present and found in quiescence with Chandra.},

@article{Chou2008a,
	abstract = {We report the results of a pulse variation analysis for the fourth discovered accretion-powered millisecond pulsar, XTE J1807-294, during its 2003 outburst as observed by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer. Pulsation is significantly detected only in the first ~90 out of ~150 days' observations. The pulse phase variation is too complex to be described by a model with orbital motion plus a simple polynomial. Precise orbital parameters, with Porb = 40.073601(8) minutes and ax sin i = 4.823(5) lt-ms, were obtained after detrending the pulse phases in daily observed 150 s segments, folded with a constant spin frequency without including the Keplerian orbit. The binary barycenter-corrected pulse phases show a smooth evolution and clear negative phase shifts coincident with the flares seen in the light curve and with enhancements of fractional pulse amplitude. The nonflare pulse phases for the first ~60 days of data are well described by a fourth-degree polynomial implying that the neutron star was spun up during the first ~60 days with a rate \dot{nu } = (1.7 $\pm$ 0.3) × 10-13 Hz s-1 at the beginning of the outburst. Significant soft phase lags up to ~500 mus (~0.1 cycles) between 2 and 20 keV were detected for the nonflare pulse phases. We conclude that the anomalous phase shifts are unlikely to be due to the accretion torque but could result from movement of the "hot spot" on the surface of the neutron star.},

	abstract = {Context. The nature of the hard X-ray source XSS J12270-4859 is still unclear. It was claimed to be a possible magnetic cataclysmic variable of the Intermediate Polar type from its optical spectrum and a possible 860 s X-ray periodicity in RXTE data. However, recent observations do not support the latter variability, leaving this X-ray source still unclassified.  Aims: To investigate its nature we present a broad-band X-ray and gamma ray study of this source based on a recent XMM-Newton observation and archival INTEGRAL and RXTE data. Using the Fermi/LAT 1-year point source catalogue, we tentatively associate XSS J12270-4859 with 1FGL J1227.9-4852, a source of high-energy gamma rays with emission up to 10 GeV. We further complement the study with UV photometry from XMM-Newton and ground-based optical and near-IR photometry.  Methods: We have analysed both timing and spectral properties in the gamma rays, X-rays, UV and optical/near-IR bands of XSS J12270-4859.  Results: The X-ray emission is highly variable, showing flares and intensity dips. The flares consist of flare-dip pairs. Flares are detected in both X-rays and the UV range, while the subsequent dips are present only in the X-ray band. Further aperiodic dipping behaviour is observed during X-ray quiescence, but not in the UV. The broad-band 0.2-100 keV X-ray/soft gamma ray spectrum is featureless and well described by a power law model with Gamma = 1.7. The high-energy spectrum from 100 MeV to 10 GeV is represented by a power law index of 2.45. The luminosity ratio between 0.1-100 GeV and 0.2-100 keV is ~0.8, indicating that the GeV emission is a significant component of the total energy output. Furthermore, the X-ray spectrum does not greatly change during flares, quiescence and the dips seen in quiescence. The X-ray spectrum however hardens during the post-flare dips, where a partial covering absorber is also required to fit the spectrum. Optical photometry acquired at different epochs reveals a period of 4.32 hr that could be ascribed to the binary orbital period. Near-IR, possibly ellipsoidal, variations are detected. Large amplitude variability on shorter (tens mins) timescales is found to be non-periodic.  Conclusions: The observed variability at all wavelengths together with the spectral characteristics strongly favour a low-mass atypical low-luminosity X-ray binary and are against a magnetic cataclysmic variable nature. The association with a Fermi/LAT high-energy gamma ray source further strengths this interpretation.

	abstract = {PSR J1023+0038 is an exceptional system for understanding how slowly rotating neutron stars are spun up to millisecond rotational periods through accretion from a companion star. Observed as a radio pulsar from 2007-2013, optical data showed that the system had an accretion disk in 2000/2001. Starting at the end of 2013 June, the radio pulsar has become undetectable, suggesting a return to the previous accretion-disk state, where the system more closely resembles an X-ray binary. In this Letter we report the first targeted X-ray observations ever performed of the active phase and complement them with UV/optical and radio observations collected in 2013 October. We find strong evidence that indeed an accretion disk has recently formed in the system and we report the detection of fast X-ray changes spanning about two orders of magnitude in luminosity. No radio pulsations are seen during low flux states in the X-ray light curve or at any other times.},

@article{Kylafis2015a,
	abstract = {Context. A rich phenomenology has been accumulated over the years regarding accretion and ejection in black-hole X-ray transients (BHTs) and it needs an interpretation.  Aims: Here we summarize the current observational picture of the outbursts of BHTs, based on the evolution traced in a hardness-luminosity diagram (HLD), and we offer a physical interpretation.  Methods: The basic ingredient in our interpretation is the Poynting-Robertson cosmic battery (PRCB), which provides locally the poloidal magnetic field needed for the ejection of the jet. In addition, we make two assumptions, easily justifiable. The first is that the mass-accretion rate to the black hole in a BHT outburst has a generic bell-shaped form, whose characteristic time scale is much longer than the dynamical or the cooling ones. This is guaranteed by the observational fact that all BHTs start their outburst and end it at the quiescent state, i.e., at very low accretion rate, and that state transitions take place over long time scales (hours to days). The second assumption is that at low accretion rates the accretion flow is geometrically thick, ADAF-like, while at high accretion rates it is geometrically thin. Last, but not least, we demonstrate that the previous history of the system is absolutely necessary for the interpretation of the HLD.  Results: Both, at the beginning and the end of an outburst, the PRCB establishes a strong poloidal magnetic field in the ADAF-like part of the accretion flow, and this explains naturally why a jet is always present in the right part of the HLD. In the left part of the HLD, the accretion flow is in the form of a thin disk, and such a disk cannot sustain a strong poloidal magnetic filed. Thus, no jet is expected in this part of the HLD. Finally, the counterclockwise traversal of the HLD is explained as follows: all outbursts start from the quiescent state, in which the inner part of the accretion flow is ADAF-like, threaded by a poloidal magnetic field. As the accretion rate increases and the source moves to the hard state, the poloidal magnetic field in the ADAF forces the flow to remain ADAF and the source to move upwards in the HLD rather than to turn left. Thus, the history of the system determines the counterclockwise traversal of the HLD. As a result, no BHT is expected to ever traverse the entire HLD curve in the clockwise direction.  Conclusions: We offer a physical interpretation of accretion and ejection in BHTs with only one parameter, the mass transfer rate, plus the history of the system.},

	abstract = {In this paper we report on the available X-ray data collected by INTEGRAL, Swift, and XMM-Newton during the first outburst of the INTEGRAL transient IGR J17451-3022, discovered in 2014 August. The monitoring observations provided by the JEM-X instruments on board INTEGRAL and the Swift /XRT showed that the event lasted for about 9 months and that the emission of the source remained soft for the entire period. The source emission is dominated by a thermal component (kT ~ 1.2 keV), most likely produced by an accretion disk. The XMM-Newton observation carried out during the outburst revealed the presence of multiple absorption features in the soft X-ray emission that could be associated with the presence of an ionized absorber lying above the accretion disk, as observed in many high inclination, low mass X-ray binaries. The XMM-Newton data also revealed the presence of partial and rectangular X-ray eclipses (lasting about 820 s) together with dips. The rectangular eclipses can be associated with increases in the overall absorption column density in the direction of the source. The detection of two consecutive X-ray eclipses in the XMM-Newton data allowed us to estimate the source orbital period at Porb = 22620.5+2.0-1.8 s (1sigma confidence level).},

	abstract = {We report on intermittent X-ray pulsations with a frequency of 442.36 Hz from the neutron star X-ray binary SAX J1748.9-2021 in the globular cluster NGC 6440. The pulsations were seen during both 2001 and 2005 outbursts of the source, but only intermittently, appearing and disappearing on timescales of hundreds of seconds. We find a suggestive relation between the occurrence of type I X-ray bursts and the appearance of the pulsations, but the relation is not strict. This behavior is very similar to that of the intermittent accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar HETE J1900.1-2455. The reason for the intermittence of the pulsations remains unclear. However, it is now evident that a strict division between pulsating and nonpulsating neutron star systems does not exist. By studying the Doppler shift of the pulsation frequency we determine an orbit with a period of 8.7 hr and a projected semimajor axis of 0.39 lt-s. The companion star might be a main-sequence or a slightly evolved star with a mass of ~1 M&sun;. Therefore, SAX J1748.9-2021 has a longer period and may have a more massive companion star than all the other accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars except for Aql X-1.},

	abstract = {The pulsar PSR B1259-63 is in a highly eccentric 3.4-yr orbit with the Be star SS 2883. Timing observations of this pulsar, made over a 7-yr period using the Parkes 64-m radio telescope, cover two periastron passages, in 1990 August and 1994 January. The timing data cannot be fitted by the normal pulsar and Keplerian binary parameters. A timing solution including a (non-precessing) Keplerian orbit and timing noise (represented as a polynomial of fifth order in time) provides a satisfactory fit to the data. However, because the Be star probably has a significant quadrupole moment, we prefer to interpret the data by a combination of timing noise, dominated by a cubic phase term, and omega^. and x^. terms. We show that the omega^. and x^. terms are likely to be a result of a precessing orbit caused by the quadrupole moment of the tilted companion star. We further rule out a number of possible physical effects which could contribute to the timing data of PSR B1259-63 on a measurable level.},

	abstract = {The Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP) demands, besides the validity of the Einstein Equivalence Principle, that all self-gravitating bodies feel the same acceleration in an external gravitational field. It has been found that metric theories of gravity other that than general relativity typically predict a violation of the SEP. In case of the Earth-Moon system (weak field system) this violation is called the Nordtvedt effect. It has been shown by Damour and Schaefer, that small-eccentricity long-orbital-period binary pulsars with a white dwarf companion provide excellent conditions to test the SEP in strong field regimes. Based on newly discovered binary pulsars this paper investigates a possible violation of the SEP in strong field regimes. New limits with an improved confidence level are presented. The results of this paper lead to constrains on the combination ε/2+zeta of the only two (post)^2^-Newtonian parameters ε and zeta that arise from the (post)^2^-Newtonian approximation of the tensor-multi-scalar theory of Damour and Esposito-Farese.},

@article{Wex1998a,
	abstract = {In binary radio pulsars with a main-sequence star companion, the spin-induced quadrupole moment of the companion gives rise to a precession of the binary orbit. As a first approximation one can model the secular evolution caused by this classical spin-orbit coupling by linear-in-time changes of the longitude of periastron and the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar orbit. This simple representation of the precession of the orbit neglects two important aspects of the orbital dynamics of a binary pulsar with an oblate companion. First, the quasiperiodic effects along the orbit, owing to the anisotropic 1/r^3 nature of the quadrupole potential. Secondly, the long-term secular evolution of the binary orbit, which leads to an evolution of the longitude of periastron and the projected semi-major axis, which is non-linear in time. In this paper a simple timing formula for binary radio pulsars with a main-sequence star companion is presented which models the short-term secular and most of the short-term periodic effects caused by the classical spin-orbit coupling. I also give extensions of the timing formula that account for long-term secular changes in the binary pulsar motion. It is shown that the short-term periodic effects are important for the timing observations of the binary pulsar PSR B1259-63. The long-term secular effects are likely to become important in the next few years of timing observations of the binary pulsar PSR J0045-7319. They could help to restrict or even determine the moments of inertia of the companion star and thus probe its internal structure. Finally, I reinvestigate the spin-orbit precession of the binary pulsar PSR J0045-7319 since the analysis given in the literature is based on an incorrect expression for the precession of the longitude of periastron. A lower limit of 20 deg for the inclination of the B star with respect to the orbital plane is derived.},

@article{Freire2010a,
	abstract = {In this paper, we express the relativistic propagational delay of light in the space-time of a binary system (commonly known as the `Shapiro delay') as a sum of harmonics of the orbital period of the system. We do this first for near-circular orbits as a natural expansion of an existing orbital model for low-eccentricity binary systems. The amplitudes of the third and higher harmonics can be described by two new post-Keplerian (PK) parameters proportional to the amplitudes of the third and fourth harmonics (h3, h4). For high orbital inclinations we use a PK parameter proportional to the ratio of amplitudes of successive harmonics (varsigma) instead of h4. The new PK parameters are much less correlated with each other than r and s, and provide a superior description of the constraints introduced by the Shapiro delay on the orbital inclination and the masses of the components of the binary. A least-squares fit that uses h3 always converges, unlike in the case of the (r, s) parametrization; its resulting statistical significance is the best indicator of whether the Shapiro delay has been detected. Until now these constraints could only be derived from Bayesian chi2 maps of the (cosi, mc) space. We show that for low orbital inclinations even these maps overestimate the masses of the components and that this can be corrected by mapping the orthogonal (h3, h4) space instead. Finally, we extend the h3, varsigma parametrization to eccentric binaries with high orbital inclinations. For some such binaries we can measure extra PK parameters and test general relativity using the Shapiro delay parameters. In this case we can use the measurement of h3 as a test of general relativity. We show that this new test is not only more stringent than the r test, but it is even more stringent than the previous s test. Until now this new parametric test could only be derived statistically from an analysis of a probabilistic chi2 map.},

Combining our radio timing measurements with results based on optical observations, we derive complete 3D velocity information for this system. Correcting for Doppler effects, we derive the intrinsic spin parameters of this pulsar and a characteristic age of 8.6+/-1.9Gyr. Our upper limit for the orbital eccentricity of only 8×10-7 (68 per cent confidence level) is the smallest ever measured for a binary system. We demonstrate that this makes the pulsar an ideal laboratory in which to test certain aspects of alternative theories of gravitation. Our precision measurements suggest deviations from a simple pulsar spin-down timing model, which are consistent with timing noise and the extrapolation of the known behaviour of slowly rotating pulsars.},

We have developed TEMPO2, a new pulsar-timing package that contains propagation and other relevant effects implemented at the 1-ns level of precision (a factor of ~100 more precise than previously obtainable). In contrast with earlier timing packages, TEMPO2 is compliant with the general relativistic framework of the IAU 1991 and 2000 resolutions and hence uses the International Celestial Reference System, Barycentric Coordinate Time and up-to-date precession, nutation and polar motion models. TEMPO2 provides a generic and extensible set of tools to aid in the analysis and visualization of pulsar-timing data. We provide an overview of the timing model, its accuracy and differences relative to earlier work. We also present a new scheme for predictive use of the timing model that removes existing processing artefacts by properly modelling the frequency dependence of pulse phase.},

	abstract = {Swift J1749.4-2807 is a transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary that contains an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar spinning at 518 Hz. It is the first of its kind that displays X-ray eclipses, which holds significant promise to precisely constrain the mass of the neutron star. We report on a ~= 105 ks long XMM-Newton observation performed when Swift J1749.4-2807 was in quiescence. We detect the source at a 0.5-10 keV luminosity of sime1 × 1033(D/6.7 kpc)2 erg s-1. The X-ray light curve displays three eclipses that are consistent in orbital phase and duration with the ephemeris derived during outburst. Unlike most quiescent neutron stars, the X-ray spectrum can be adequately described with a simple power law, while a pure-hydrogen atmosphere model does not fit the data. We place an upper limit on the 0.01-100 keV thermal luminosity of the cooling neutron star of <~ 2 × 1033 erg s-1 and constrain its temperature to be <~ 0.1 keV (for an observer at infinity). Timing analysis does not reveal evidence for X-ray pulsations near the known spin frequency of the neutron star or its first overtone with a fractional rms of <~ 34% and <~ 28%, respectively. We discuss the implications of our findings for dynamical mass measurements, the thermal state of the neutron star, and the origin of the quiescent X-ray emission.},

@article{Miller2013a,
	abstract = {We report on an observation of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Serpens X-1, made with NuSTAR. The extraordinary sensitivity afforded by NuSTAR facilitated the detection of a clear, robust, relativistic Fe K emission line from the inner disk. A relativistic profile is required over a single Gaussian line from any charge state of Fe at the 5sigma level of confidence, and any two Gaussians of equal width at the same confidence. The Compton back-scattering "hump" peaking in the 10-20 keV band is detected for the first time in a neutron star X-ray binary. Fits with relativistically blurred disk reflection models suggest that the disk likely extends close to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) or stellar surface. The best-fit blurred reflection models constrain the gravitational redshift from the stellar surface to be z NS >= 0.16. The data are broadly compatible with the disk extending to the ISCO; in that case, z NS >= 0.22 and R NS <= 12.6 km (assuming M NS = 1.4 M &sun; and a = 0, where a = cJ/GM 2). If the star is as large or larger than its ISCO, or if the effective reflecting disk leaks across the ISCO to the surface, the redshift constraints become measurements. We discuss our results in the context of efforts to measure fundamental properties of neutron stars, and models for accretion onto compact objects.},

@article{Cackett2010a,
	abstract = {A number of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) have recently been discovered to show broad, asymmetric Fe K emission lines in their X-ray spectra. These lines are generally thought to be the most prominent part of a reflection spectrum, originating in the inner part of the accretion disk where strong relativistic effects can broaden emission lines. We present a comprehensive, systematic analysis of Suzaku and XMM-Newton spectra of 10 neutron star LMXBs, all of which display broad Fe K emission lines. Of the 10 sources, 4 are Z sources, 4 are atolls, and 2 are accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars (also atolls). The Fe K lines are fit well by a relativistic line model for a Schwarzschild metric, and imply a narrow range of inner disk radii (6-15 GM/c 2) in most cases. This implies that the accretion disk extends close to the neutron star surface over a range of luminosities. Continuum modeling shows that for the majority of observations, a blackbody component (plausibly associated with the boundary layer) dominates the X-ray emission from 8 to 20 keV. Thus it appears likely that this spectral component produces the majority of the ionizing flux that illuminates the accretion disk. Therefore, we also fit the spectra with a blurred reflection model, wherein a blackbody component illuminates the disk. This model fits well in most cases, supporting the idea that the boundary layer illuminates a geometrically thin disk.},

	abstract = {We analysed the XMM-Newton archival observations of 16 neutron star (NS), low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) to study the Fe K emission in these objects. The sample includes all the observations of NS LMXBs performed in EPIC pn timing mode with XMM-Newton publicly available until September 30, 2009. We performed a detailed data analysis considering pile-up and background effects. The properties of the Fe lines differed from previous published analyses because of either incorrect pile-up corrections or different continuum parameterisation. Eighty percent of the observations for which a spectrum can be extracted showed significant Fe line emission. We found an average line centroid of 6.67 $\pm$ 0.02 keV and a finite width, sigma, of 0.33 $\pm$ 0.02 keV. The equivalent width of the lines varied between 17 and 189 eV, with an average weighted value of 42 $\pm$ 3 eV. For sources where several observations were available, the Fe line parameters changed between observations whenever the continuum changed significantly. The line parameters did not show any correlation with luminosity. Most important, we could fit the Fe line with a simple Gaussian component for all the sources. The lines did not show the asymmetric profiles that were interpreted as indicating relativistic effects in previous analyses of these LMXBs.

On the assumption that the observed period changes are secular and not due to some longer-term periodic change, it is argued here that the observed behavior of LMXBs can be explained as the result of mass loss from the companion star caused by irradiation of the secondary star and accretion disk by the primary. The typical lifetime of a radiation-driven LMXB is expected to be a million to ten million yrs. This reduced evolutionary timescale can resolve the statistical discrepancy between the number of binary millisecond pulsars and of their presumed LMXB progenitors if about half of all the LMXBs are radiation-driven.},

	abstract = {The radiative and hydrodynamical processes occurring near the region where the pulsar wind interacts with the material outflowing from the illuminated companion star atmosphere are addressed. The emphasis is placed on the properties of a class of 'hidden' millisecond pulsars. Attention is given to three different classes of star-vaporizing pulsars (SVPs) characterized by a radio-emission which turns out to be sharply defined (type I), loosely defined (type II), and absent (type III), respectively. It is suggested that even though the pulsed and continuum radio emission of hidden SVPs is probably completely blocked, they can be visible in the X-ray band, gamma-ray band, and indirectly. It is shown how a class of blue stragglers might contain a rapidly spinning neutron star. Since the radiation spectrum originating from the bubble surrounding an SVP can be either relatively soft or a power-law extending up energy about 100 GeV, hidden SVPs can be important for the interpretation of X-ray and gamma-ray sources already known or to be discovered by ongoing missions such as Rosat and GRO.},

For minimum companion masses <~0.1 Msolar, adiabatic evolution and consequent mass loss under gravitational radiation appear to provide a coherent explanation of all observable properties. We suggest that the group of BWPs with minimum companion masses >~0.1 Msolar are systems relaxing to equilibrium after a relatively recent capture event. We point out that all binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with orbital periods P<~ 10 h are BWPs (our line of sight allows us to see the eclipses in 10 out of 16 cases). This implies that recycled MSPs emit either in a wide fan beam or a pencil beam close to the spin plane. Simple evolutionary ideas favour a fan beam.},

These results are used to refine previous measurements of the orbital period decay of all sources (where available) and provide the first accurate values of the apsidal advance in Vela X-1 and 4U 1538-522. Updated values for the masses of the neutron stars hosted in the ten HMXBs are also provided, as well as the long-term light curves folded on the best determined orbital parameters of the sources. These light curves reveal complex eclipse ingresses and egresses that are understood mostly as being caused by accretion wakes. Our results constitute a database to be used for population and evolutionary studies of HMXBs and for theoretical modeling of long-term accretion in wind-fed X-ray binaries.

	abstract = {We report the first extensive set of optical photometric observations of the counterpart to SAX J1808.4-3658 (V4580 Sagittarii) in quiescence. The source was detected at V~21, 5mag fainter than at the peak of its 1998 outburst. However, a comparable ~6 per cent semi-amplitude 2-h modulation of its flux is revealed. This has the same phasing and approximately sinusoidal modulation as seen during outburst, and with photometric minimum when the pulsar is behind the companion. The lack of a double-humped morphology rules out an ellipsoidal origin, implying that the bulk of the optical flux does not arise from the companion. Moreover, applying crude modelling to the disc and X-ray irradiated face of the donor shows that the internal energy release of a remnant disc (with mass transfer driven by gravitational radiation) is sufficient to explain most of the optical emission, and with the modulation because of the varying contribution of the heated face of the star. We note that this model is also consistent with the much lower X-ray to optical flux ratio in quiescence versus outburst, and with the phasing of the optical modulation.},

	abstract = {The optical counterpart of the binary millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 during quiescence was detected at V = 21.5 mag, inconsistent with intrinsic emission from the faint companion star. We propose that the optical emission from this system during quiescence is due to the reprocessing by the companion star and a remnant accretion disk of the rotational energy released by the fast spinning neutron star, switched on, as magneto-dipole rotator (radio pulsar), during quiescence. In this scenario the companion behaves as a bolometer, reprocessing in optical the intercepted fraction of the power emitted by the pulsar. Our computations indicate that the observed optical magnitudes are fully consistent with this hypothesis. In this case the observed optical luminosity may be the first evidence that a radio pulsar is active in this system during quiescence.},

@article{Crawford2013a,
	abstract = {We present a study of PSR J1723-2837, an eclipsing, 1.86 ms millisecond binary radio pulsar discovered in the Parkes Multibeam survey. Radio timing indicates that the pulsar has a circular orbit with a 15 hr orbital period, a low-mass companion, and a measurable orbital period derivative. The eclipse fraction of ~15% during the pulsar's orbit is twice the Roche lobe size inferred for the companion. The timing behavior is significantly affected by unmodeled systematics of astrophysical origin, and higher-order orbital period derivatives are needed in the timing solution to account for these variations. We have identified the pulsar's (non-degenerate) companion using archival ultraviolet, optical, and infrared survey data and new optical photometry. Doppler shifts from optical spectroscopy confirm the star's association with the pulsar and indicate a pulsar-to-companion mass ratio of 3.3 $\pm$ 0.5, corresponding to a companion mass range of 0.4 to 0.7 M &sun; and an orbital inclination angle range of between 30$\,^{\circ}$ and 41$\,^{\circ}$, assuming a pulsar mass range of 1.4-2.0 M &sun;. Spectroscopy indicates a spectral type of G for the companion and an inferred Roche-lobe-filling distance that is consistent with the distance estimated from radio dispersion. The features of PSR J1723-2837 indicate that it is likely a "redback" system. Unlike the five other Galactic redbacks discovered to date, PSR J1723-2837 has not been detected as a gamma-ray source with Fermi. This may be due to an intrinsic spin-down luminosity that is much smaller than the measured value if the unmeasured contribution from proper motion is large.},

@article{Damour1992a,
	abstract = {Observations of pulsars in gravitationally bound binary systems provide a unique opportunity for testing the strong-field regime of relativistic gravity. We present a detailed account of the ``parametrized post-Keplerian'' (PPK) formalism, a general phenomenological framework designed to extract the maximum possible information from pulsar timing and pulse-structure data. The PPK approach allows dynamical information to be obtained from the data in a theory-independent way, and encoded in a certain number of fitted post-Keplerian parameters. We show that as many as 19 such parameters can be measured, under favorable conditions, giving access to 15 possible tests of relativistic gravity. We isolate and quantify the theoretical content of these tests by deriving, within the framework of generic boost-invariant theories, expressions linking the phenomenological parameters to the inertial masses of the pulsar and its companion, and to the polar angles of the spin axis of the pulsar. The prospects for extracting some of these tests from observations of known or yet-to-be-discovered binary pulsars is quantitatively assessed through numerical simulations. We show that the recently discovered binary pulsar PSR 1534+12 should, with presently available data, give access to two new strong-field tests of relativistic gravity, if the data are analyzed in the phenomenological way emphasized in this paper. Moreover, in the long run, the first-disovered binary pulsar, PSR 1913+16, could give access to three strong-field tests, beyond the presently obtained omega˙-gamma-P˙b test. Finally, we show how, by combining the PPK approach with the predictions of a rather generic class of tensor biscalar theories, one can bring together tests based on observations of several different pulsars. We illustrate how such a combination of independent tests can lead to very tight quantitative constraints on possible strong-field deviations from the correct theory of gravity.},

@article{Damour1991a,
	abstract = {We reexamine the theoretical significance of the raw observational parameter called the "rate of orbital period change," Psobs, of the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16. We show that the current precision (˜0.8%) on the determination of Psobs makes it necessary to take explicitly into account the effects of the galactic accelerations of the pulsar and the Sun, and that of the proper motion of the pulsar. Several other possible contributions to Psobs are (re)examined and found negligible. As the value of the galactic contribution to Psb/Pb depends explicitly on the distance to the pulsar, say d, we have been led to reexamine the determination of d from dispersion measurements. We find that recent progress in H I absorption measurements in the first galactic longitude quadrant allows one to constrain the mean electron density along the line of sight to PSR 1913+ 16 (1 = 50$\,^{\circ}$) to the range ne(50$\,^{\circ}$) = ([6.39$\pm$0.93] [R0/1 kpc])-1 cm-3, where R0 is the galactocentric distance of the Sun. This value for ne is smaller than the "standard" one and leads to a galactic-reduced distance to PSR 1913+16, d/R0= 1.08$\pm$0.16. After subtraction of the galactic effects, the latest experimental results yield a 0.8 % confirmation of the general relativistic prediction:Psobs-gal/b / PsGR/b = - 1.0081$\pm$0.0022(galactic) $\pm$0.0076(observational). Alternatively, this result yields an upper bound to the rate of change of Newton's gravitational constant, Gs/G = (1.10$\pm$1.07) × 10-11 yr-1, which, in the long term, may be limited to the $\pm$3 × 10-12 yr-1 level of precision because of the uncertainties in the values of the galactic constants, R0 and upsilo0.},

	abstract = {We report 15 new VRI light curves of five low-mass eclipsing binaries (NSVS 02502726, NSVS 07453183, NSVS 11868841, NSVS 06550671 and NSVS 10653195) that were observed between 2010 and 2012. We analysed our new data together with three published spectroscopic observations and seven published light curves using a modified version of the Wilson-Devinney program. Orbital solutions of the five low-mass eclipsing binaries were revised and new star-spot parameters were obtained. We found that spot locations on the five low-mass eclipsing binaries changed over several years. However, the star-spots for NSVS 07453183 and NSVS 06550671 were stable for several months. More interestingly, for NSVS 02502726, the spots within a star-spot longitude region of 180$\,^{\circ}$-360$\,^{\circ}$ indicated a magnetic activity cycle of 5.9($\pm$0.2) yr. Moreover, we detected the first flare-like event on NSVS 07453183 at phase 0.39. The observations of the chromospheric activity indicators (Hbeta and Hgamma lines) revealed that NSVS 10653195 and NSVS 06550671 were active. For NSVS 02502726, we found a weak continuous secular decrease at a smaller rate of dp/dt = -2.1(0.8) × 10-7 d yr-1 than the previous result. For NSVS 07453183, the O-C times appeared to increase at cycle 6000, and this was followed by a decrease at cycle 6500.},

	abstract = {4U 1820-30 is a low-mass X-ray binary near the center of the globular cluster NGC 6624 consisting of, at least, one neutron star and one helium white dwarf. Analyzing 16 yr of data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) allows us to measure its orbital period and its time derivative with unprecedented accuracy to be P = 685.01197 $\pm$ 0.00003 s and \dot{P}{/}P=-5.3+/- 0.3× 10-8 yr-1. Hence, we confirm that the period derivative is significantly negative at the >17sigma level, contrary to theoretical expectations for an isolated X-ray binary. We discuss possible scenarios that could explain this discrepancy and conclude that the center of NGC 6624 most likely contains large amounts of nonluminous matter such as dark remnants. We also discuss the possibility of an IMBH inside NGC 6624, or that a dark remnant close to 4U 1820-30 causes the observed shift.},

The 6.5-yrs radio timing measurements have revealed a significant secular variation of the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar at a rate of dot xequiv d(a1 sin i)/dt = (-0.23+/- 0.03)x 10-12, which is probably caused by the Newtonian spin-orbit coupling in this binary system leading to a precession of the orbital plane. The required misalignment of the spin and orbital angular momenta of the companion are evidence for an asymmetric supernova explosion. We have also confirmed that the orbital period is currently decreasing at a rate of dot Pb=(-15.5 +/- 0.8)x 10-12 s s-1 and have measured second and third orbital period derivatives d2Pb/dt2=(+2.1 +/- 0.3)x 10-20: s-1 and d3Pb/dt3 =(3.6 +/- 0.6)x 10-28: s-2, which indicate a quasi-cyclic orbital period variation similar to those found in another eclipsing pulsar system, PSR B1957+20. The observed variation of the orbital parameters constrains the maximal value of the companion radius to Rc: max ~ 0.06: Rsun and implies that the companion is underfilling its Roche lobe by 50%. The derived variation in the quadrupole moment of the companion is probably caused by tidal dissipation similar to the mechanism proposed for PSR B1957+20. We conclude that the companion is at least partially non-degenerate, convective and magnetically active.},

@article{Jain2010a,
	abstract = {4U 1822-37 is a low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) system with an accretion disc corona. It is one of the very few LMXBs that shows narrow X-ray eclipses and small amplitude pulsations of the neutron star. The X-ray eclipse is an excellent reference for measurement of orbital evolution of the binary, and we have obtained 16 new mid-eclipse time measurements of this source during the last 13 years using X-ray observations made with the RXTE-PCA, RXTE-ASM, Swift-XRT, XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories. These, along with the earlier known mid-eclipse times have been used to accurately determine the time-scale for a change in the orbital period of 4U 1822-37. We have derived an orbital period Porb = 0.23210887(15) d, which is changing at the rate of d d-1 (at T0 = MJD 45614). The time-scale for a change in the orbital period is of 4.9(1.1) × 106 yr. We also report the detection of 0.59290132(11) s (at T0 = MJD 51975) X-ray pulsations from the source with a long-term average of -2.481(4) × 10-12 s s-1, i.e. a spin-up time-scale () of 7578(13) yr. In view of these results, we have discussed various mechanisms that could be responsible for the orbital evolution in this system. Assuming the extreme case of conservative mass transfer, we have found that the measured requires a large mass transfer rate of (4.2-5.2) × 10-8 Msolar yr-1 which together with the spin-up rate implies a magnetic field strength in the range of (1-3) × 108G. Using the long-term RXTE-ASM light curve, we have found that the X-ray intensity of the source has decreased over the last 13 yr by ~40 per cent and there are long-term fluctuations at time-scales of about a year. In addition to the long-term intensity variation, we have also observed significant variation in the intensity during the eclipse. Variation was also seen in the pulse profile, which could be due to changes in the accretion geometry. We briefly discuss the implications of these results on our understanding of the properties of the neutron star and the accretion geometry in this source.},

The increased data span allows significant measurements of the orbital eccentricity, e= (6.2 $\pm$ 1.3) × 10-5, and composite proper motion, mut= 7.3 $\pm$ 0.4 mas yr-1. Our timing observations have revealed secular variations of the projected semimajor axis of the pulsar orbit which are much more extreme than those previously published and of the orbital period of the system. Investigations of the physical mechanisms producing such variations confirm that the variations of the semimajor axis are most probably caused by classical spin-orbit coupling in the binary system, while the variations in orbital period are most likely caused by tidal dissipation leading to changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion.},

The main focus is on the stellar astrophysics of X-ray binaries  leading to the production of fully recycled MSPs with white dwarf (WD) or substellar semi-degenerate companions.  Depending on the nature of the companion star MSPs are believed to form  from either low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) or intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs).  For each of these two classes of X-ray binaries  the evolutionary status of the donor star  - or equivalently, the orbital period - at the onset of the Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) is the determining factor for  the outcome of the mass-transfer phase and thus the nature of the MSP formed.  Furthermore, the formation of binary MSPs is discussed in context of the PP-diagram, as well as new interpretations  of the Corbet diagram.  Finally, I present new models of Case A RLO of IMXBs in order to reproduce the two solar mass pulsar PSR J1614-2230.},

	abstract = {The radio millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038 exhibits complex timing and eclipse behavior. Here we analyze four years' worth of radio monitoring observations of this object. We obtain a long-term timing solution, albeit with large residual timing errors as a result of apparent orbital period variations. We also observe variable eclipses when the companion passes near our line of sight, excess dispersion measure near the eclipses and at random orbital phases, and short-term disappearances of signal at random orbital phases. We interpret the eclipses as possibly due to material in the companion's magnetosphere supported by magnetic pressure, and the orbital period variations as possibly due to a gravitational quadrupole coupling mechanism. Both of these mechanisms would be the result of magnetic activity in the companion, in conflict with evolutionary models that predict it should be fully convective and hence non-magnetic. We also use our timing data to test for orbital and rotational modulation of the system's $\gamma$-ray emission, finding no evidence for orbital modulation and $3.7\sigma$ evidence for modulation at the pulsar period. The energetics of the system make it plausible that the $\gamma$-ray emission we observe is entirely from the millisecond pulsar itself, but it seems unlikely for these $\gamma$-rays to provide the irradiation of the companion, which we attribute instead to X-ray heating from a shock powered by a particle wind.},

	abstract = {We present the results of precision gamma-ray timing measurements of the binary millisecond pulsar PSR J2339-0533, an irradiating system of the ``redback'' type, using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. We describe an optimized analysis method to determine a long-term phase-coherent timing solution spanning more than six years, including a measured eccentricity of the binary orbit and constraints on the proper motion of the system. A major result of this timing analysis is the discovery of an extreme variation of the nominal 4.6 hr orbital period {P}{orb} over time, showing alternating epochs of decrease and increase. We inferred a cyclic modulation of {P}{orb} with an approximate cycle duration of 4.2 yr and a modulation amplitude of {{Delta }}{P}{orb}/{P}{orb}=2.3× {10}-7. Considering different possible physical causes, the observed orbital-period modulation most likely results from a variable gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion star due to cyclic magnetic activity in its convective zone.},

@article{Deloye2008a,
	abstract = {We observed the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 with Gemini-South in g' and i' bands, nearly simultaneous with XMM-Newton observations. A clear periodic flux modulation on the system's orbital period is present, consistent with the varying aspect of the donor star's heated face. We model the contributions of a disc and donor star to these optical bands. To produce the observed modulation amplitudes, we conclude that the donor must be irradiated by an external flux two orders of magnitude greater than provided by the measured X-ray luminosity. A possible explanation for this irradiation is that the radio pulsar mechanism becomes active during the quiescent state as suggested by Burderi et al., with relativistic particles heating the donor's day side face. Our modelling constrains the binary inclination to be 36$\,^{\circ}$-67$\,^{\circ}$. We obtain estimates for the pulsar mass of >2.2Msolar (although this limit is sensitive to the source's distance), consistent with the accelerated neutron star cooling in this system indicated by X-ray observations. We also estimate the donor mass to be 0.07-0.11Msolar, providing further indications that the system underwent non-standard binary evolution to reach its current state.},

	abstract = {We have assembled a sample of 1187 thermonuclear (type I) X-ray bursts from observations of 48 accreting neutron stars by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, spanning more than 10 years. The sample contains examples of two of the three theoretical ignition regimes (confirmed via comparisons with numerical models) and likely examples of the third. We present a detailed analysis of the variation of the burst profiles, energetics, recurrence times, presence of photospheric radius expansion, and presence of burst oscillations, as a function of accretion rate. We estimated the distance for 35 sources exhibiting radius-expansion bursts, and found that the peak flux of such bursts varies typically by 13%. We classified sources into two main groups based on the burst properties: (1) both long and short bursts (indicating mixed H/He accretion), and (2) consistently short bursts (primarily He accretion), and we calculated the mean burst rate as a function of accretion rate for the two groups. The decrease in burst rate observed at >0.06MEdd (>~2×1037 ergs s-1) is associated with a transition in the persistent spectral state and (as has been suggested previously) may be related to the increasing role of steady He burning. We found many examples of bursts with recurrence times <30 minutes, including burst triplets and even quadruplets. We describe the oscillation amplitudes for 13 of the 16 burst oscillation sources, as well as the stages and properties of the bursts in which the oscillations are detected. The burst properties are correlated with the burst oscillation frequency; sources spinning at <400 Hz generally have consistently short bursts, while the more rapidly spinning systems have both long and short bursts. This correlation suggests either that shear-mediated mixing dominates the burst properties, or alternatively that the nature of the mass donor (and hence the evolutionary history) has an influence on the long-term spin evolution.},

@article{Galloway2006a,
	abstract = {We analyzed Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the accretion-powered 401 Hz pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658, in order to precisely determine the source distance. While the fluences for the five transient outbursts observed from 1996 were constant to within the uncertainties, the outburst interval varied significantly, so that the time-averaged flux (and accretion rate) decreased by around 40%. By equating the time-averaged X-ray flux with the expected mass transfer rate from gravitational radiation, we derived a lower limit on the distance of 3.4 kpc. Combined with an upper limit from assuming that the four radius-expansion thermonuclear bursts observed during the 2002 October outburst reached at most the Eddington limit for a pure He atmosphere, we found that the probable distance range for the source is 3.4-3.6 kpc. The implied inclination, based on the optical/IR properties of the counterpart, is i<~30deg. We compared the properties of the bursts with an ignition model. The time between bursts was long enough for hot CNO burning to significantly deplete the accreted hydrogen, so that ignition occurred in a pure helium layer underlying a stable hydrogen-burning shell. This is the first time that this burning regime has been securely observationally identified. The observed energetics of the bursts give a mean hydrogen fraction at ignition of <X>~0.1, and require that the accreted hydrogen fraction X0 and the CNO metallicity ZCNO are related by ZCNO~0.03(X0/0.7)2. We show that in this burning regime, a measurement of the burst recurrence time and energetics allows the local accretion rate onto the star to be determined independently of the accreted composition, giving a new method for estimating the source distance that is in good agreement with our other estimates.},

@article{Chakrabarty1998a,
	abstract = {Typical radio pulsars are magnetized neutron stars that are born rapidly rotating and slow down as they age on time scales of 10 to 100 million years. In contrast, millisecond radio pulsars spin very rapidly even though many are billions of years old. The most compelling explanation is that they have been `spun up' by the transfer of angular momentum during the accretion of material from a companion star in so-called low-mass X-ray binary systems, LMXBs. (LMXBs consist of a neutron star or black hole accreting matter from a companion with mass less than one solar mass.) The recent detection of coherent X-ray pulsations with a millisecond period from a suspected low-mass X-ray binary system appears to confirm this link. Here we report observations showing that the orbital period of this binary system is two hours, which establishes it as an LMXB. We also find an apparent modulation of the X-ray flux at the orbital period (at the two per cent level), with a broad minimum when the pulsar is behind the low-mass companion star. This system seems closely related to the `black-widow' millisecond radio pulsars, which are evaporating their companions through irradiation. It may appear as an eclipsing radio pulsar during periods of X-ray quiescence.},

It was detected at a peak intensity of 0.1 Crab (2 to 10 keV) and lasted between 6 and 40 days above a detection threshold of 2 mCrab. Two very bright type I X-ray bursts were detected from this transient in the same observations. These almost certainly identify this X-ray transient as a low-mass X-ray binary with a neutron star as compact component. The double-peaked time history of both bursts at high energies suggests a peak luminosity close to the Eddington limit. Assuming this to be true implies a distance to this object of 4 kpc.},

	abstract = {The aperiodic X-ray variability in neutron star and black hole X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) shows a characteristic linear relationship between rms amplitude and flux, implying a multiplying together or `coupling' of variability on different time-scales. Such a coupling may result from avalanches of flares, due to magnetic reconnection in an X-ray-emitting corona. Alternatively this coupling may arise directly from the coupling of perturbations in the accretion flow, which propagate to the inner emitting regions and so modulate the X-ray emission. Here, we demonstrate explicitly that the component of aperiodic variability that carries the rms-flux relation in the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 is also coupled to the 401-Hz pulsation in this source. This result implies that the rms-flux relation in SAX J1808.4-3658 is produced in the accretion flow on to the magnetic caps of the neutron star, and not in a corona. By extension we infer that propagating perturbations in the accretion flow, and not coronal flares, are the source of the rms-flux relations and hence the aperiodic variability in other XRBs and AGN.},

	abstract = {We report the finding of an unusual, weak precursor to a thermonuclear X-ray burst from the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. The burst in question was observed on 2002 October 19 with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer Proportional Counter Array (RXTE PCA). The precursor began ~1 s prior to the onset of a strong radius expansion burst, lasted for about 0.4 s, and exhibited strong oscillations at the 401 Hz spin frequency. Oscillations are not detected in the ~0.5 s interval between the precursor and the main burst. The estimated peak photon flux and energy fluence of the precursor are about 1/25 and 1/500 that of the main burst, respectively. From joint spectral and temporal modeling, we find that an expanding burning region with a relatively low temperature on the spinning neutron star surface can explain the oscillations, as well as the faintness of the precursor with respect to the main part of the burst. We discuss some of the implications of our findings for the ignition and spreading of thermonuclear flames on neutron stars.},

	abstract = {SAX J1808.4-3658 has a 2.5 ms neutron star rotation period and exhibits X-ray pulsations due to its rotating hot spot. Here we present an analysis of the pulse shapes of SAX J1808.4-3658 during its 1998 outburst. The modeling of the pulse shape includes several effects, including gravitational light bending, Doppler effects, and two spectral components with different emissivity. In addition, we include the new effects of light travel time delays and the neutron star's oblate shape. We also consider two different data sets, with different selections in time period (1 vs. 19 days of data combined) and different energy binning and time resolution. We find that including time delays and oblateness results in a stronger restriction on allowed masses and radii. A second result is that the choice of data selection strongly affects the allowed masses and radii. Overall, the derived constraints on mass and radius favor compact stars and a soft equation of state.},

@article{Cornelisse2009a,
	abstract = {Aims: We obtained phase-resolved spectroscopy of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 during its outburst in 2008 to find a signature of the donor star, constrain its radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_2), and derive estimates for the pulsar mass. Methods: Using Doppler images of the Bowen region, we find a significant (>=8sigma) compact spot at a position where the donor star is expected. If this is a signature of the donor star, we measure K_em = 248$\pm$20 km s-1 (1sigma confidence), which represents a strict lower limit to K_2. Also, the Doppler map of He II lambda4686 shows the characteristic signature of the accretion disc, and there is a hint of enhanced emission that may be a result of tidal distortions in the accretion disc that are expected in very low mass-ratio interacting binaries.  Results: The lower limit on K2 leads to a lower limit on the mass function of f(M_1) >= 0.10 M_&sun;. Applying the maximum K-correction gives 228 < K2 < 322 km s-1 and a mass ratio of 0.051 < q < 0.072. Conclusions: Despite the limited S/N of the data, we were able to detect a signature of the donor star in SAX J1808.4-3658, although future observations during a new outburst are still needed to confirm this. If the derived K_em is correct, the largest uncertainty in determining of the mass of the neutron star in SAX J1808.4-3658 using dynamical studies lies with the poorly known inclination.

@article{Wang2009a,
	abstract = {We report on optical imaging of the X-ray binary SAX J1808.4 - 3658 with the 8 m Gemini South Telescope. The binary, containing an accretion-powered millisecond pulsar, appears to have a large periodic modulation in its quiescent optical emission. In order to clarify the origin of this modulation, we obtained three time-resolved r'-band light curves (LCs) of the source over five days. The LCs can be described by a sinusoid, and the long time-span between them allows us to determine optical period P = 7251.9 s and phase 0.671 at MJD 54599.0 (TDB; phase 0.0 corresponds to the ascending node of the pulsar orbit), with uncertainties of 2.8 s and 0.008 (90% confidence), respectively. This periodicity is highly consistent with the X-ray orbital ephemeris. By considering this consistency and the sinusoidal shape of the LCs, we rule out the possibility of the modulation arising from the accretion disk. Our study supports the previous suggestion that the X-ray pulsar becomes rotationally powered in quiescence, with its energy output irradiating the companion star, causing the optical modulation. While it has also been suggested that the accretion disk would be evaporated by the pulsar, we argue that the disk exists and gives rise to the persistent optical emission. The existence of the disk can be verified by long-term, multiwavelength optical monitoring of the source in quiescence, as an increasing flux and spectral changes from the source would be expected based on the standard disk-instability model.},

	abstract = {An outburst of the accreting X-ray millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 in 2002 October-November was followed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer for more than a month. A detailed analysis of this unprecedented data set is presented. For the first time, we demonstrate how the area covered by the hotspot at the neutron star surface is decreasing in the course of the outburst together with the reflection amplitude. These trends are in agreement with the natural scenario, where the disc inner edge is receding from the neutron star as the mass accretion rate drops. These findings are further supported by the variations of the pulse profiles, which clearly show the presence of the secondary maximum at the late stages of the outburst after October 29. This fact can be interpreted as the disc receding sufficiently far from the neutron star to open the view of the lower magnetic pole. In that case, the disc inner radius can be estimated. Assuming that disc is truncated at the Alfv{\'e}n radius, we constrain the stellar magnetic moment to mu = (9 +/- 5) × 1025 G cm3, which corresponds to the surface field of about 108 G. On the other hand, using the magnetic moment recently obtained from the observed pulsar spin-down rate we show that the disc edge has to be within factor of 2 of the Alfv{\'e}n radius, putting interesting constraints on the models of the disc-magnetosphere interaction. We also demonstrate that the sharp changes in the phase of the fundamental are intimately related to the variations of the pulse profile, which we associate with the varying obscuration of the antipodal spot. Using the phase-resolved spectra, we further argue that the strong dependence of the pulse profiles on photon energy and the observed soft time lags result from the different phase dependence of the normalizations of the two spectral components, the blackbody and the Comptonized tail, being consistent with the model, where these components have significantly different angular emission patterns. The pulse profile amplitude allows us to estimate the colatitude of the hotspot centroid to be ~4$\,^{\circ}$-10$\,^{\circ}$.},

@article{Morsink2011a,
	abstract = {The pulse shapes detected during multiple outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658 are analyzed in order to constrain the neutron star's mass and radius. We use a hot-spot model with a small scattered-light component to jointly fit data from two different epochs, under the restriction that the star's mass and radius and the binary's inclination do not change from epoch to epoch. All other parameters describing the spot location, emissivity, and relative fractions of blackbody to Comptonized radiation are allowed to vary with time. The joint fit of data from the 1998 "slow decay" and the 2002 "end of outburst maximum" epochs using the constraint i < 90$\,^{\circ}$ leads to the 3sigma confidence constraint on the neutron star mass 0.8 M sun < M < 1.7 M sun and equatorial radius 5 km < R < 13 km. Inclinations as low as 41$\,^{\circ}$ are allowed. The best-fit models with M>1.0 M sun from joint fits of the 1998 data with data from other epochs of the 2002 and 2005 outbursts also fall within the same 3sigma confidence region. This 3sigma confidence region allows a wide variety of hadronic equations of state, in contrast with an earlier analysis by Leahy et al. of only the 1998 outburst data that only allowed for extremely small stars.},

	abstract = {Accreting millisecond pulsars show significant variability of their pulse profiles, especially at low accretion rates. On the other hand, their X-ray spectra are remarkably similar with not much variability over the course of the outbursts. For the first time, we have discovered that during the 2008 outburst of SAX J1808.4-3658 a major pulse profile change was accompanied by a dramatic variation of the disc luminosity at almost constant total luminosity. We argue that this phenomenon is related to a change in the coupling between the neutron star magnetic field and the accretion disc. The varying size of the pulsar magnetosphere can influence the accretion curtain geometry and affect the shape and the size of the hotspots. Using this physical picture, we develop a self-consistent model that successfully describes simultaneously the pulse profile variation as well as the spectral transition. Our findings are particularly important for testing the theories of accretion on to magnetized neutron stars, better understanding of the accretion geometry as well as the physics of disc-magnetosphere coupling. The identification that varying hotspot size can lead to pulse profile changes has profound implications for determination of the neutron star masses and radii.},

	abstract = {We report on time-resolved optical imaging of the X-ray binary SAX J1808.4-3658 during its quiescent state and 2008 outburst. The binary, containing an accretion-powered millisecond pulsar, has a large sinusoidal-like modulation in its quiescent optical emission. We employ a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to fit our multi-band light curve data in quiescence with an irradiated star model, and derive a tight constraint of 50^{+6}_{-5} deg on the inclination angle i of the binary system. The pulsar and its companion are constrained to have masses of 0.97^{+0.31}_{-0.22} M_{&sun;} and 0.04^{+0.02}_{-0.01} M_{&sun;} (both 1sigma ranges), respectively. The dependence of these results on the measurements of the companion's projected radial velocity is discussed. We also find that the accretion disk had nearly constant optical fluxes over a ~500 day period in the quiescent state our data covered, but started brightening 1.5 months before the 2008 outburst. Variations in modulation during the outburst were detected in our four observations made 7-12 days after the start of the outburst, and a sinusoidal-like modulation with 0.2 mag amplitude changed to have a smaller amplitude of 0.1 mag. The modulation variations are discussed. We estimate the albedo of the companion during its quiescence and the outburst, which was approximately 0 and 0.8 (for isotropic emission), respectively. This large difference probably provides additional evidence that the neutron star in the binary turns on as a radio pulsar in quiescence.},

For the RPM, the derived NS masses of Cyg X-2, SAX J1808.4-3658 and 4U 1820-30 are 1.96 $\pm$ 0.10, 2.83 $\pm$ 0.04 and 1.85 $\pm$ 0.02 M&sun;, respectively. These are, respectively, ˜30, 100 and 40 per cent higher than the measured results 1.5 $\pm$ 0.3, <1.4 and 1.29^{+0.19}_{-0.07} M&sun;. For the AWOM, where the free parameter of the model is the density of the star, we infer the NS radii to be around 10-20 km for the above three sources. Based on this, we can infer the matter compositions inside the NSs with the help of the equations of state. In particular, for SAX J1808.4-3658, the AWOM shows a lower mass density for its NS than those of the other known kHz QPO sources, with a radius range of 17-20 km, which excludes the strange quark matter inside its star.},

@article{Pinto2014a,
	abstract = {Context. Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are a natural workbench to study accretion disk phenomena and optimal background sources to measure elemental abundances in the interstellar medium (ISM). In high-resolution XMM-Newton spectra, the LMXB SAX J1808.4-3658 in the past showed a neon column density significantly higher than expected given its small distance, presumably due to additional absorption from a neon-rich circumstellar medium (CSM).  Aims: It is possible to detect intrinsic absorption from the CSM by evidence of Keplerian motions or outflows. For this purpose, we analyze a recent, deep (100 ks long), high-resolution Chandra/LETGS spectrum of SAX J1808.4-3658 in combination with archival data.  Methods: We estimated the column densities of the different absorbers through the study of their absorption lines. We used both empirical and physical models involving photo- and collisional-ionization to determine the nature of the absorbers.  Results: The abundances of the cold interstellar gas match the solar values as expected given the proximity of the X-ray source. For the first time in this source, we detected neon and oxygen blueshifted absorption lines, which can be well modeled with outflowing photoionized gas. The wind is neon rich (Ne/O ≳ 3) and may originate from processed, ionized gas near the accretion disk or its corona. The kinematics (v = 500-1000 km s-1) are indeed similar to those seen in other accretion disks. We also discovered a system of emission lines with very high Doppler velocities (v ~ 24 000 km s-1) originating presumably closer to the compact object. Additional observations and UV coverage are needed to accurately determine the abundances and the ionization structure of the wind.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of a 1-5 Hz X-ray flaring phenomenon observed at >30 mCrab near peak luminosity in the 2008 and 2011 outbursts of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 in observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. In each of the two outbursts this high luminosity flaring is seen for ~3 continuous days and switches on and off on a timescale of 1-2 hr. The flaring can be seen directly in the light curve, where it shows sharp spikes of emission at quasi-regular separation. In the power spectrum it produces a broad noise component, which peaks at 1-5 Hz. The total 0.05-10 Hz variability has a fractional rms amplitude of 20%-45%, well in excess of the 8%-12% rms broadband noise usually seen in power spectra of SAX J1808.4-3658. We perform a detailed timing analysis of the flaring and study its relation to the 401 Hz pulsations. We find that the pulse amplitude varies proportionally with source flux through all phases of the flaring, indicating that the flaring is likely due to mass density variations created at or outside the magnetospheric boundary. We suggest that this 1-5 Hz flaring is a high mass accretion rate version of the 0.5-2 Hz flaring which is known to occur at low luminosity (<13 mCrab), late in the tail of outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658. We propose the dead-disk instability, previously suggested as the mechanism for the 0.5-2 Hz flaring, as a likely mechanism for the high luminosity flaring reported here.},

	abstract = {We report the detection of a possible gamma-ray counterpart of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. The analysis of ˜6 yr of data from the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi-LAT) within a region of 15$\,^{\circ}$ radius around the position of the pulsar reveals a point gamma-ray source detected at a significance of ˜6sigma (test statistic TS = 32), with a position compatible with that of SAX J1808.4-3658 within the 95 per cent confidence level. The energy flux in the energy range between 0.6 and 10 GeV amounts to (2.1 $\pm$ 0.5) × 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1 and the spectrum is represented well by a power-law function with photon index 2.1 $\pm$ 0.1. We searched for significant variation of the flux at the spin frequency of the pulsar and for orbital modulation, taking into account the trials due to the uncertainties in the position, the orbital motion of the pulsar and the intrinsic evolution of the pulsar spin. No significant deviation from a constant flux at any time-scale was found, preventing a firm identification via time variability. Nonetheless, the association of the LAT source as the gamma-ray counterpart of SAX J1808.4-3658 would match the emission expected from the millisecond pulsar, if it switches on as a rotation-powered source during X-ray quiescence.},

	abstract = {We present the calibration of the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) X-ray satellite. We used the Crab as the primary effective area calibrator and constructed a piece-wise linear spline function to modify the vignetting response. The achieved residuals for all off-axis angles and energies, compared to the assumed spectrum, are typically better than $\pm$2% up to 40 keV and 5%-10% above due to limited counting statistics. An empirical adjustment to the theoretical two-dimensional point-spread function (PSF) was found using several strong point sources, and no increase of the PSF half-power diameter has been observed since the beginning of the mission. We report on the detector gain calibration, good to 60 eV for all grades, and discuss the timing capabilities of the observatory, which has an absolute timing of $\pm$3 ms. Finally, we present cross-calibration results from two campaigns between all the major concurrent X-ray observatories (Chandra, Swift, Suzaku, and XMM-Newton), conducted in 2012 and 2013 on the sources 3C 273 and PKS 2155-304, and show that the differences in measured flux is within ˜10% for all instruments with respect to NuSTAR.},

	abstract = {A set of CCD images have been obtained during the decline of the X-ray transient SAX J1808.4 - 3658 during 1998 April-June. The optical counterpart has been confirmed by several pieces of evidence. The optical flux shows a modulation on several nights that is consistent with the established X-ray binary orbit period of 2 h. This optical variability is roughly in antiphase with the weak X-ray modulation. The source mean magnitude of V=16.7 on April 18 declined rapidly after April 22. From May 2 onwards the magnitude was more constant at around V=18.45 but by June 27 it was below our sensitivity limit. The optical decline precedes the rapid second phase of the X-ray decrease by 3 +/- 1 d. The source has been identified on a 1974 UK Schmidt plate at an estimated magnitude of ~ 20. The nature of the optical companion is discussed.},

We present timing and spectral analyses of this observation, in particular the first pulse profile study below 2keV, and the high-resolution spectral analysis of this source during the outburst. Combined spectral and pulse profile analyses suggest the presence of a strong unpulsed source below 2keV that strongly reduces the pulsed fraction and a hard pulsed component that generates markedly double peaked profiles at higher energies. We also studied the high-resolution grating spectrum of SAX J1808.4-3658, and found several absorption edges and oxygen absorption lines with whom we infer, in a model independent way, the interstellar column densities of several elements in the direction of SAX J1808.4-3658.},

@article{Lewis10,
	abstract = {Context. In August 2008, the accreting milli-second X-ray pulsar (AMXP), IGR J00291+5934, underwent an outburst lasting ~100 days, the first since its discovery in 2004.  Aims: We present data from the 2008 double-peaked outburst of IGR J00291+5934 from Faulkes Telescope North, the Isaac Newton Telescope, the Keck Telescope, PAIRITEL, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the Swift, XMM-Newton and RXTE X-ray missions. We study the outburst's evolution at various wavelengths, allowing us to probe accretion physics in this AMXP.  Methods: We study the light curve morphology, presenting the first radio-X-ray spectral energy Distributions (SEDs) for this source and the most detailed UV-IR SEDs for any outbursting AMXP. We show simple models that attempt to identify the emission mechanisms responsible for the SEDs. We analyse short-timescale optical variability, and compare a medium resolution optical spectrum with those from 2004.  Results: The outburst morphology is unusual for an AMXP, comprising two peaks, the second containing a ``plateau'' of ~10 days at maximum brightness within 30 days of the initial activity. This has implications on duty cycles of short-period X-ray transients. The X-ray spectrum can be fitted by a single, hard power-law. We detect optical variability of ~0.05 mag, on timescales of minutes, but find no periodic modulation. In the optical, the SEDs contain a blue component, indicative of an irradiated disc, and a transient near-infrared (NIR) excess. This excess is consistent with a simple model of an optically thick synchrotron jet (as seen in other outbursting AMXPs), however we discuss other potential origins. The optical spectrum shows a double-peaked Halpha profile, a diagnostic of an accretion disc, but we do not clearly see other lines (e.g. He I, II) that were reported in 2004.  Conclusions: Optical/IR observations of AMXPs appear to be excellent for studying the evolution of both the outer accretion disc and the inner jet, and may eventually provide us with tight constraints to model disc-jet coupling in accreting neutron stars.

	abstract = {A detailed analysis of a long XMM-Newton observation of the narrow-line type 1 Seyfert galaxy 1H0707-495 is presented, including spectral fitting, spectral variability and timing studies. The two main features in the spectrum are the drop at ~7keV and a complex excess below 1keV. These are well described by two broad, K and L, iron lines. Alternative models based on absorption, although they may fit the high-energy drop, cannot account for the 1keV complexity and the spectrum as a whole. Spectral variability shows that the spectrum is composed of at least two components, which are interpreted as a power law dominating between 1-4keV and a reflection component outside this range. The high count rate at the iron L energies has enabled us to measure a significant soft lag of ~30 s between 0.3-1 and 1-4keV, meaning that the direct hard emission leads the reflected emissions. We interpret the lag as a reverberation signal originating within a few gravitational radii of the black hole.},

	abstract = {We have studied the rapid X-ray time variability in 149 pointed observations with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)'s Proportional Counter Array of the atoll source 4U 1636-53 in the banana state and, for the first time with RXTE, in the island state. We compare the frequencies of the variability components of 4U 1636-53 with those in other atoll and Z sources and find that 4U 1636-53 follows the universal scheme of correlations previously found for other atoll sources at (sometimes much) lower luminosities. Our results on the hectohertz QPO suggest that the mechanism that sets its frequency differs from that for the other components, while the amplitude-setting mechanism is common. A previously proposed interpretation of the narrow low-frequency QPO frequencies in different sources in terms of harmonic mode switching is not supported by our data or by previous data on other sources, and the frequency range that this QPO covers is found to be unrelated to spin, angular momentum, or luminosity.},

	abstract = {The incidence of evaporating `black widow' pulsars (BWPs) among all millisecond pulsars is far higher in globular clusters than in the field. This implies a special formation mechanism for them in clusters. Cluster millisecond pulsars in wide binaries with white dwarf companions exchange them for turnoff-mass stars. These new companions eventually overflow their Roche lobes because of encounters and tides. The millisecond pulsars eject the overflowing gas from the binary, giving mass loss on the binary evolution time-scale. The systems are only observable as BWPs at epochs where this evolution is slow, making the mass loss transparent and the lifetime long. This explains why observed BWPs have low-mass companions. We suggest that at least some field BWPs were ejected from globular clusters or entered the field population when the cluster itself was disrupted.},

The color-intensity evolution of the system, coupled to the properties of its fast time variability, allow the identification of four separate states. Depending on the state, strong noise is detected, together with a variety of quasi-periodic oscillations at frequencies from 0.2 to 8 Hz. We present a characterization of the timing parameters of these states and compare them to what has been observed in other systems. These results, together with those obtained from energy spectra, point towards a common evolution of black-hole transients through their outbursts.},

We have made timing analysis of these gap observations and found, in one observation, two simultaneous kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). The timing parameters of these kHz QPOs fit in the overall trend of the source. The `lower' kHz QPO has a centroid frequency of ~308 Hz. This is the lowest `lower' kHz QPO frequency ever observed in 4U 1728-34. The peak frequency separation between the `upper' and the `lower' kHz QPO is Deltanu= 274 +/- 11 Hz, significantly smaller than the constant value of Deltanu~ 350 Hz found when the `lower' kHz QPO frequency is between ~500 and 800 Hz. This is the first indication in this source for a significant decrease of kHz QPO peak separation towards low frequencies. We compare the result briefly to theoretical models for kHz QPO production.},

@article{Tarana11,
	abstract = {We report results of a one-year monitoring of the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) source (atoll type) 4U 1728-34 with INTEGRAL and RXTE. Three time intervals were covered by INTEGRAL, during which the source showed strong spectral evolution. We studied the broad-band X-ray spectra in detail by fitting several models in the different sections of the hardness-intensity diagram. The soft states are characterized by prominent blackbody emission plus a contribution from a Comptonized emission. The hard states are characterized by the presence of an excess flux with respect to the Comptonization model above 50 keV, while the soft component is fainter. To obtain an acceptable fit to the data, this excess is modelled either with a power law with photon index Gamma˜ 2 or a Comptonization (CompPS) spectrum implying the presence of hybrid thermal and non-thermal electrons in a corona. This makes 4U 1728-34 one of the few LMXBs of atoll type showing non-thermal emission at high energy. From our analysis, it is also apparent that the presence of the hard tail is more prominent as the overall spectrum becomes harder. We also discuss alternative models which can describe these hard states.},

@article{Lavagetto05,
	abstract = {We study the evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries hosting a neutron star and of millisecond binary radio pulsars using numerical simulations that take into account the detailed evolution of the companion star, of the binary system, and of the neutron star. According to general relativity, when energy is released during accretion or due to magnetodipole radiation during the pulsar phase, the system loses gravitational mass. Moreover, the neutron star can collapse to a black hole if its mass exceeds a critical limit, which depends on the equation of state of ultradense matter and is typically ~2Msolar. These facts have some interesting consequences. (i) In a millisecond radio pulsar the mass-energy is lost with a specific angular momentum that is smaller than the specific angular momentum of the system, resulting in a positive contribution to the orbital period derivative. If this contribution is dominant and can be measured, we can extract information about the moment of inertia of the neutron star, since the energy loss rate depends on it. Such a measurement can help to put constraints on the equation of state of ultradense matter. (ii) In low-mass X-ray binaries below the bifurcation period (~18 h), the neutron star survives the `period gap' only if its mass is smaller than the maximum non-rotating mass when the companion becomes fully convective and accretion pauses. Since in such evolutions ~0.8Msolar can be accreted on to the neutron star, short-period (P<= 2 h) millisecond X-ray pulsars such as SAX J1808.4-3658 can be formed only if either a large part of the accreting matter has been ejected from the system, or the equation of state of ultradense matter is very stiff. (iii) In low-mass X-ray binaries above the bifurcation period, the mass-energy loss lowers the mass transfer rate. As a side effect, the inner core of the companion star becomes ~1 per cent bigger than in a system with a non-collapsed primary. As a result of this difference, the final orbital period of the system is 20 per cent longer than if the mass-energy loss effect is not taken into account.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of phase shifts between X-ray pulses at different energies in the newly discovered millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. The results show that low-energy pulses lag high-energy pulses by as much as ~0.2 ms (or ~8% of the pulse period). The measurements were made in two different ways: (1) computing cross-power spectra between different energy bands, and (2) cross-correlating the folded pulse profiles in different energy bands; consistent results were obtained. We speculate that the observed soft lags might be related to the lateral expansion and subsequent cooling of a ``hot spot'' on the neutron star surface in which the pulsed X-ray emission originates. Also presented is the possibility of producing soft lags via Compton downscattering of hard X-ray photons from the hot spot in the cool surrounding atmosphere. We will discuss possible X-ray production mechanisms for SAX J1808.4-3658 and constraints on the emission environment, based on the observed soft lags, pulse profiles, and energy spectrum.},

@article{Muno02,
	abstract = {We present a comprehensive observational and theoretical analysis of the amplitudes and profiles of oscillations that occur during thermonuclear X-ray bursts from weakly magnetized neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries. Our sample contains 59 oscillations from six sources observed with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer. The oscillations that we examined occurred primarily during the decaying portions of bursts and lasted for several seconds each. We find that the oscillations are as large as 15% during the declines of the bursts and that they appear and disappear because of intrinsic variations in their fractional amplitudes. However, the maxima in the amplitudes are not related to the underlying flux in the burst. We derive folded profiles for each oscillation train to study the pulse morphologies. The mean rms amplitudes of the oscillations are 5%, although the eclipsing source MXB 1659-298 routinely produces 10% oscillations in weak bursts. We also produce combined profiles from all of the oscillations from each source. Using these pulse profiles, we place upper limits on the fractional amplitudes of harmonic and half-frequency signals of 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively (95% confidence). These correspond to less than 5% of the strongest signal at integer harmonics and less than 10% of the main signal at half-integer harmonics. We then compare the pulse morphologies with theoretical profiles from models with one or two antipodal bright regions on the surface of a rotating neutron star. We find that if one bright region is present on the star, it must either lie near the rotational pole or cover nearly half the neutron star in order to be consistent with the observed lack of harmonic signals. If an antipodal pattern is present, the hot regions must form very near the rotational equator. We discuss how these geometric constraints challenge current models for the production of surface brightness variations during the cooling phases of X-ray bursts.},

@article{Muno03,
	abstract = {We examine the energy-resolved pulse profiles of 51 flux oscillations observed during the declines of thermonuclear X-ray bursts from accreting weakly magnetized neutron stars with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer. In general, we find that (1) the amplitudes of the oscillations increase as a function of energy, and (2) the pulses observed in the higher energy bands arrive later than those in lower energy bands, although the magnitude of the energy dependence varies significantly from burst to burst. Averaging groups of bursts from individual sources, we demonstrate that fractional rms amplitudes of the oscillations increase as a function of energy by 0.25%-0.9% keV-1 between 3 and 20 keV and are as large as 20% in the 13-20 keV band. We also show that the average delays between pulses observed in the high- and low-energy bands are 0.002-0.007 cycles keV-1 between 3 and 20 keV. This amounts to total delays of 0.03-0.12 cycles between the lowest and highest energy bands or time delays that range from 100 to 200 mus. We model the oscillations as flux variations arising from temperature patterns on the surfaces of rapidly rotating neutron stars. In this framework, we find that the increase in the pulse amplitude with photon energy can be explained if the cooler regions on the neutron star emit in the lower energy bands, reducing the flux variations there. On the other hand, the Doppler shifts caused by the rapid rotation of the neutron star should cause the hard pulses to precede the soft pulses by about 0.05 cycles (100 mus), in contrast to the observations. This suggests that the photons originating from the stellar surface are reprocessed by a hot corona of electrons before they reach the observer.},

	abstract = {We study the pulse profiles of the accreting X-ray millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 at different energies. The two main emission components, the blackbody and the Comptonized tail, which are clearly identified in the time-averaged spectrum, show strong variability with the first component lagging the second one. The observed variability can be explained if the emission is produced by Comptonization in a hot slab (radiative shock) of Thomson optical depth ~0.3-1 at the neutron star surface. The blackbody radiation is strongly beamed along the normal to the slab (a `knife'-like or `pencil'-like emission pattern), while the Comptonized emission has a broader angular distribution peaking at about 50$\,^{\circ}$-60$\,^{\circ}$ from the slab normal (a `fan'-like pattern). We construct a detailed model of the X-ray production accounting for the Doppler boosting, relativistic aberration and gravitational light bending in the Schwarzschild space-time. We present also accurate analytical formulae for computations of the light curves from rapidly rotating neutron stars using the formalism recently developed by Beloborodov. Our model reproduces well the pulse profiles at different energies simultaneously, corresponding phase lags, as well as the time-averaged spectrum. We constrain the compact star mass to be bounded between 1.2 and 1.6 Msolar. By fitting the observed profiles, we determine the radius of the compact object to be R~ 11 km if M= 1.6 Msolar, while for M= 1.2 Msolar the best-fitting radius is ~6.5 km, indicating that the compact object in SAX J1808.4-3658 can be a strange star. We obtain a lower limit on the inclination of the system of 65$\,^{\circ}$.},

	abstract = {The recent discovery of the first known accretion-powered millisecond pulsar with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer provides the first direct probe of the interaction of an accretion disk with the magnetic field of a weakly magnetic (B<~1010 G) neutron star. We demonstrate that the presence of coherent pulsations from a weakly magnetic neutron star over a wide range of accretion rates places strong constraints on models of the disk-magnetosphere interaction. We argue that the simple M3/7 scaling law for the Keplerian frequency at the magnetic interaction radius, widely used to model disk accretion onto magnetic stars, is not consistent with observations of SAX J1808.4-3658 for most proposed equations of state for stable neutron stars. We show that the usually neglected effects of multipole magnetic moments, radiation drag forces, and general relativity must be considered when modeling such weakly magnetic systems. Using only very general assumptions, we obtain a robust estimate of mu~=(1-10)×1026 G cm3 for the dipole magnetic moment of SAX J1808.4-3658, implying a surface dipole field of ~108-109 G at the stellar equator. We therefore infer that after the end of its accretion phase, this source will become a normal millisecond radio pulsar. Finally, we compare the physical properties of this pulsar with those of the nonpulsing, weakly magnetic neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries and argue that the absence of coherent pulsations from the latter does not necessarily imply that these neutron stars have significantly different magnetic field strengths from SAX J1808.4-3658.},

@article{Kuulkers03,
	abstract = {We examined the maximum bolometric peak luminosities during type I X-ray bursts from the persistent or transient luminous X-ray sources in globular clusters. We show that for about two thirds of the sources the maximum peak luminosities during photospheric radius expansion X-ray bursts extend to a critical value of 3.79 +/- 0.15 *E38 erg s-1, assuming the total X-ray burst emission is entirely due to black-body radiation and the recorded maximum luminosity is the actual peak luminosity. This empirical critical luminosity is consistent with the Eddington luminosity limit for hydrogen poor material. Since the critical luminosity is more or less always reached during photospheric radius expansion X-ray bursts (except for one source), such bursts may be regarded as empirical standard candles. However, because significant deviations do occur, our standard candle is only accurate to within 15%. We re-evaluated the distances to the twelve globular clusters in which the X-ray bursters reside.},

Processed images are presented illustrating the unusual central luminosity distribution, and a high-resolution color map of the center is given to demonstrate the behavior of B - V across the core. The central surface brightness and core radius are determined and the tidal radius is estimated from a mean luminosity profile in the B band. A color profile (B - V) indicates a possible slight trend toward bluer colors with increasing radius. An initial color-magnitude diagram is derived down to V = 19.0, apparently reaching just to the red horizontal branch. In addition to the cluster center, blue stars in the field are identified for further study as X-ray source candidates.},

It has a spin frequency of 182 Hz (5.5 ms) and an orbital period of 54.7 minutes. The minimum companion mass is between 0.0067 and 0.0086 Msolar, depending on the mass of the neutron star, and the upper limit on the mass is 0.030 Msolar (95% confidence level). Such a low mass is inconsistent with brown dwarf models, and comparison with white dwarf models suggests that the companion is a He-dominated donor whose thermal cooling has been at least modestly slowed by irradiation from the accretion flux. No X-ray bursts, dips, eclipses, or quasi-periodic oscillations were detected. The current outburst lasted ~13 days, and no earlier outbursts were found in archival data.},

We detect strong (~35%) flat-topped broadband noise throughout the outburst with low characteristic frequencies (~0.1 Hz). This makes SWIFT J1756.9-2508 similar to the rest of AMPs and to other low-luminosity accreting neutron stars when they are in their hard states, and enables us to classify this AMP as an atoll source in the extreme island state.

We present here the first study of the 0.5-200 keV broad-band spectra of the source. On February 28, the source spectrum was consistent with thermal Comptonization by electrons of temperature ~40 keV, considerably higher than the value (~10 keV) previously derived from the low energy XMM-Newton data alone. The source is detected by INTEGRAL up to 200 keV with a luminosity in the energy band (0.1-200) keV of 1.3 × 1037 erg s-1 (assuming a distance of 8 kpc). 22 days later the luminosity dropped to 3.6 × 1036 erg s-1. A re-analysis of XMM-Newton data yields the orbital Doppler variations of the pulse period and refines the previous ephemeris. For this source, with shortest orbital period of any known binary radio or X-ray millisecond pulsar, we constrain the companion mass Mc < 0.022~M&sun;, assuming minimum mass transfer driven by gravitational radiation. Only evolved dwarfs with a C/O composition are consistent with the Roche lobe and gravitational radiation constraints, while He dwarfs require an unlikely low inclination.},

@article{Falanga11,
	abstract = {Context. IGR J17511-3057 is the second X-ray transient accreting millisecond pulsar discovered by INTEGRAL. It was in outburst for about a month beginning on September 13, 2009.  Aims: We analyze the spectral and timing properties of the object and the characteristics of X-ray bursts with the aim to constrain the physical processes responsible for the X-ray production in this class of sources.  Methods: We studied the broad-band spectrum of the persistent emission in the 0.8-300 keV energy band using simultaneous INTEGRAL, RXTE and Swift data obtained in September 2009. We also describe the timing properties in the 2-120 keV energy range such as the outburst light curve, pulse profile, pulsed fraction, pulsed emission, and time lags, and moreover study the properties of X-ray bursts discovered by RXTE and INTEGRAL and the recurrence time.  Results: The broad-band average spectrum is well described by thermal Comptonization with an electron temperature of kTe ~ 25 keV, soft seed photons of kTbb ~ 0.6 keV, and Thomson optical depth tauT ~ 2 in a slab geometry. During the outburst the spectrum stays remarkably stable with plasma and soft seed photon temperatures and scattering optical depth being constant within errors. We fitted the outburst profile with the exponential model, and using the disk instability model we inferred the outer disk radius to be (4.8-5.4) × 1010 cm. The INTEGRAL and RXTE data reveal the X-ray pulsation at a period of 4.08 milliseconds up to ~120 keV. The pulsed fraction is shown to decrease from ~22% at 3 keV to a constant pulsed fraction of ~17-18% between 7-30 keV, and then to decrease again to ~13% at 60 keV. The nearly sinusoidal pulses show soft lags that monotonically increase with energy to about 0.2 ms at 10-20 keV similar to those observed in other accreting pulsars. The short burst profiles indicate hydrogen-poor material at ignition, which suggests either that the accreted material is hydrogen-deficient, or that the CNO metallicity is up to a factor of 2 times solar. However, the variation of the burst recurrence time as a function of m (inferred from the X-ray flux) is much smaller than predicted by helium-ignition models.},

	abstract = {IGR J17511-3057 is a low-mass X-ray binary hosting a neutron star and is one of the few accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars with X-ray bursts. We report on a 20 ks Chandra grating observation of IGR J17511-3057, performed on 2009 September 22. We determine the most accurate X-ray position of IGR J17511-3057, alphaJ2000 = 17h51m08.s66, deltaJ2000 = -30$\,^{\circ}$57'41farcs0 (90% uncertainty of 0farcs6). During the observation, a ~54 s long type-I X-ray burst is detected. The persistent (non-burst) emission has an absorbed 0.5-8 keV luminosity of 1.7 × 1036 erg s-1 (at 6.9 kpc) and can be well described by a thermal Comptonization model of soft, ~0.6 keV, seed photons upscattered by a hot corona. The type-I X-ray burst spectrum, with average luminosity over the 54 s duration L 0.5-8 keV = 1.6 × 1037 erg s-1, can be well described by a blackbody with kT bb ~ 1.6 keV and R bb ~ 5 km. While an evolution in temperature of the blackbody can be appreciated throughout the burst (average peak kT bb = 2.5+0.8 - 0.4 keV to tail kT bb = 1.3+0.2 - 0.1 keV), the relative emitting surface shows no evolution. The overall persistent and type-I burst properties observed during the Chandra observation are consistent with what was previously reported during the 2009 outburst of IGR J17511-3057.},

@article{Watts06,
	abstract = {The nature of the asymmetry that gives rise to Type I X-ray burst oscillations on accreting neutron stars remains a matter of debate. Of particular interest is whether the burst oscillation mechanism differs between the bursting millisecond pulsars and the non-pulsing systems. One means to diagnose this is to study the energy dependence of the burst oscillations: here we present an analysis of oscillations from 28 bursts observed during the 2003 outburst of the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338. We find that the fractional amplitude of the burst oscillations falls with energy, in contrast to the behaviour found by Muno et al. in the burst oscillations from a set of non-pulsing systems. The drop with energy mirrors that seen in the accretion-powered pulsations; in this respect XTE J1814-338 behaves like the other accreting millisecond pulsars. The burst oscillations show no evidence for either hard or soft lags, in contrast to the persistent pulsations, which show soft lags of up to 50 mus. The fall in amplitude with energy is inconsistent with current surface-mode and simple hotspot models of burst oscillations. We discuss improvements to the models and uncertainties in the physics that might resolve these issues.},

@article{Baglio13,
	abstract = {Aims: We present a study of the quiescent optical counterpart of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar XTE J1814-338 that is aimed at unveiling the different components, which contribute to the quiescent optical emission of the system.  Methods: We carried out multiband (BVR) orbital phase-resolved photometry of the system using the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) that is equipped with the FORS2 camera, covering about 70% of the 4.3 hour orbital period.  Results: The optical light curves are consistent with a sinusoidal variability that are modulated with an orbital period with a semi-amplitude of 0.5-0.7 mag. They show evidence of a strongly irradiated companion star, which agrees with previous findings for this system. However, the observed colours cannot be accounted for by the companion star alone, suggesting the presence of an accretion disc during quiescence. The system seems to be fainter in all analysed bands compared to previous observations. The R band light curve displays a possible phase offset with respect to the B and V band. Through a combined fit of the multi-band light curve performed with a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we derive constraints on the companion star, disc fluxes, system distance, and companion star mass.  Conclusions: The irradiation luminosity required to account for the observed day-side temperature of the companion star is consistent with the spin-down luminosity of a millisecond radio pulsar. Compared to our data with previous observations, which were collected over 5 years, the flux decrease and spectral evolution of the observed quiescent optical emission cannot be satisfactorily explained with the combined contribution of an irradiated companion star and of an accretion disc alone. The observed progressive flux decrease as the system gets bluer could be due to a continuum component that evolves towards a lower, bluer spectrum. While most of the continuum component is likely due to the disc, we do not expect it to become bluer in quiescence. Hence, we hypothesize that an additional component, such as synchrotron emission from a jet was significantly contributing in the data obtained earlier during quiescence and then progressively fading or moving its break frequency towards longer wavelengths.  Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the Paranal Observatory under programme ID 383.D-0730(A).},

@article{Falanga07b,
	abstract = {We present a Comptonization model for the observed properties of the energy-dependent soft/hard time lags and pulsed fraction (amplitude) associated with the pulsed emission of a neutron star (NS). We account for the soft lags by downscattering of hard X-ray photons in the relatively cold plasma of the disk or NS surface. A fraction of the soft X-ray photons coming from the disk or NS surface upscatter off hot electrons in the accretion column. This effect leads to hard lags as a result of thermal Comptonization of the soft photons. This model reproduces the observed soft and hard lags due to the down- and upscattered radiation as a function of the electron number densities of the reflector, nrefe, and the accretion column, nhote. In the case of the accretion-powered millisecond pulsars IGR J00291+5934, XTE J1751-305, and SAX J1808.4-3658, the observed time lags agree well with the model. Soft lags are observed only if nrefe<<nhote. Scattering of the pulsed emission in the NS environment may account for the observed time lags as a nonmonotonic function of energy. The time lag measurements can be used as a probe of the innermost parts of the NS and accretion disk. We determine the upper and lower limits of the density variation in this region using the observed time lags. The observed energy-dependent pulsed amplitude allows us to infer a variation of the Thomson optical depth of the Compton cloud in which the accretion column is embedded.},

@article{Wijnands05,
	abstract = {We observed the accretion-driven millisecond X-ray pulsars XTE J0929-314 and XTE J1751-305 in their quiescent states using Chandra. From XTE J0929-314 we detected 22 source photons (in the energy range 0.3-8 keV) in ~24.4 ks, resulting in a background-corrected time-averaged count rate of (9+/-2)×10-4 counts s-1. The small number of photons detected did not allow for a detailed spectral analysis of the quiescent spectrum, but we can demonstrate that the spectrum is harder than simple thermal emission, which is what is usually presumed to arise from a cooling neutron star that has been heated during the outbursts. Assuming a power-law model for the time-averaged (averaged over the whole observation) X-ray spectrum, we obtain a power-law index of 1.8+0.6-0.5 and an unabsorbed X-ray flux of 6+4-2×10-15 ergs s-1 cm-2 (for the energy range 0.5-10 keV), resulting in a 0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity of 7+5-2×1031 (d/10 kpc)2 ergs s-1, with d the distance toward the source in kiloparsecs. No thermal component could be detected; such a component contributed at most 30% to the 0.5-10 keV flux. Variability in the count rate of XTE J0929-314 was observed at the 95% confidence level. We did not conclusively detect XTE J1751-305 in our ~43 ks observation, with 0.5-10 keV flux upper limits between 0.2 and 2.7×10-14 ergs s-1 cm-2 depending on assumed spectral shape, resulting in 0.5-10 keV luminosity upper limits of (0.2-2)×1032 (d/8 kpc)2 ergs s-1. We compare our results with those obtained for other neutron star X-ray transients in their quiescent state, and in particular with the quiescent properties of SAX J1808.4-3658. Using simple accretion disk physics in combination with our measured quiescent luminosity of XTE J0929-314 and the luminosity upper limits of XTE J1751-305 and the known spin frequency of the neutron stars, we can constrain the magnetic field of the neutron stars in XTE J0929-314 and XTE J1751-305 to be less than 3×109(d/10kpc) and (3-7)×108(d/8kpc) G (depending on assumed spectral shape of the quiescent spectrum), respectively.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the first high-resolution spectra measured from an accretion-driven millisecond X-ray pulsar in outburst. We observed XTE J1751-305 with XMM-Newton on 2002 April 7 for approximately 35 ks. Using a simple absorbed blackbody plus power-law model, we measure an unabsorbed flux of (6.6+/-0.1)×10-10 ergs cm-2 s-1 (0.5-10.0 keV). A hard power-law component (Gamma=1.44+/-0.01) contributes 83% of the unabsorbed flux in the 0.5-10.0 keV band, but a blackbody component (kT=1.05+/-0.01 keV) is required. We find no clear evidence for narrow or broad emission or absorption lines in the time-averaged spectra, and the sensitivity of this observation has allowed us to set constraining upper limits on the strength of important features. The lack of line features is at odds with spectra measured from some other X-ray binaries that share some similarities with XTE J1751-305. We discuss the implications of these findings on the accretion flow geometry in XTE J1751-305.},

Simple phenomenological fits to Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Proportional Counter Array data reveal a pulsation in the iron line at the spin frequency of the neutron star. However, fitting more complex spectral models reveals a degeneracy between iron-line pulsations and changes in the underlying hotspot blackbody temperature with phase. By comparing with the variations in reflection continuum, which are much weaker than the iron-line variations, we infer that the iron line is not pulsed. The observed spectral variations can be explained by variations in blackbody temperature associated with rotational Doppler shifts at the neutron star surface. By allowing blackbody temperature to vary in this way, we also find a larger phase shift between the pulsations in the Comptonized and blackbody components than has been seen in previous work. The phase shift between the pulsation in the blackbody temperature and normalization is consistent with a simple model where the Doppler shift is maximized at the limb of the neutron star, ˜90$\,^{\circ}$ prior to maximization of the hotspot projected area.},

	abstract = {We have studied the aperiodic variability of the 401 Hz accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 using the complete data set collected with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer over 14 years of observation. The source shows a number of exceptional aperiodic timing phenomena that are observed against a backdrop of timing properties that show consistent trends in all five observed outbursts and closely resemble those of other atoll sources. We performed a detailed study of the enigmatic ~410 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO), which has only been observed in SAX J1808.4-3658. We find that it appears only when the upper kHz QPO frequency is less than the 401 Hz spin frequency. The difference between the ~410 Hz QPO frequency and the spin frequency follows a similar frequency correlation as the low frequency power spectral components, suggesting that the ~410 Hz QPO is a retrograde beat against the spin frequency of a rotational phenomenon in the 9 Hz range. Comparing this 9 Hz beat feature with the low-frequency QPO in SAX J1808.4-3658 and other neutron star sources, we conclude that these two might be part of the same basic phenomenon. We suggest that they might be caused by retrograde precession due to a combination of relativistic, classical and magnetic torques. Additionally we present two new measurements of the lower kHz QPO, allowing us, for the first time, to measure the frequency evolution of the twin kHz QPOs in this source. The twin kHz QPOs are seen to move together over 150 Hz, maintaining a centroid frequency separation of (0.446+/- 0.009){nu }{spin}.},

@article{Papitto10,
	abstract = {We report on a 70 ks XMM-Newton Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation of the newly discovered accreting millisecond pulsar, IGR J17511-3057. Pulsations at 244.8339512(1)Hz are observed throughout the outburst with an rms-pulsed fraction of 14.4(3) per cent. Pulsations have been used to derive a precise solution for the Porb = 12487.51(2) s binary system. The measured mass function indicates a main-sequence companion star with a mass between 0.15 and 0.44 Msolar.  The XMM-Newton 0.5-11keV spectrum of IGR J17511-3057 can be modelled by at least three components, which we interpret, from the softest to the hardest, as multi-coloured disc emission, thermal emission from the neutron star surface and thermal Comptonization emission. Spectral fit of the XMM-Newton data and of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data, taken in a simultaneous temporal window, well constrain the Comptonization parameters: the electron temperature, kTe = 51+6-4keV, is rather high, while the optical depth (tau = 1.34+0.03-0.06) is moderate.  The energy dependence of the pulsed fraction supports the interpretation of the cooler thermal component as coming from the accretion disc, and indicates that the Comptonizing plasma surrounds the hot spots on the neutron star surface, which in turn provides the seed photons. Signatures of reflection, such as a broadened iron Kalpha emission line and a Compton hump at ~30keV, are also detected. We derive from the smearing of the reflection component an inner disc radius of >~40km for a 1.4 Msolar neutron star, and an inclination between 38$\,^{\circ}$ and 68$\,^{\circ}$.  XMM-Newton also observed two type I X-ray bursts, whose fluence and recurrence time suggest that the bursts are ignited in a nearly pure helium environment. No photospheric radius expansion is observed, thus leading to an upper limit on the distance to the source of 10kpc. A lower limit of 6.5kpc can be also set if it is assumed that emission during the decaying part of the burst involves the whole neutron star surface. Pulsations are observed during the burst decay with an amplitude similar to the persistent emission. They are also compatible with being phase locked to pre-burst pulsations, suggesting that the location on the neutron star surface where they are formed does not change much during bursts.},

	abstract = {After 3 years of quiescence, the globular cluster NGC 6440 exhibited a bright transient X-ray source turning on in 2001 August, as noted with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer All-Sky Monitor. We carried out a short target-of-opportunity observation with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and are able to associate the transient with the brightest of 24 X-ray sources detected during quiescence in 2000 July with Chandra. Furthermore, we securely identify the optical counterpart and determine that the 1998 X-ray outburst in NGC 6440 was from the same object. This is the first time that an optical counterpart to a transient in a globular cluster is securely identified. Since the transient is a type I X-ray burster, it is established that the compact accretor is a neutron star. Thus, this transient provides an ideal case to study the quiescent emission in the optical and X-ray of a transiently accreting neutron star while knowing the distance and reddening accurately. One model that fits the quiescent spectrum is an absorbed power-law plus neutron star hydrogen atmosphere model. We find an intrinsic neutron star radius of 17+31-12 km and an unabsorbed bolometric luminosity for the neutron star atmosphere of (2.1+/-0.8)×1033 ergs s-1 that is consistent with predictions for a cooling neutron star.},

We detect 24 sources to a limiting luminosity of ~2×1031 ergs s-1 (0.5-2.5 keV) inside the cluster's half-mass radius, all of which lie within ~2 core radii of the cluster center. We also find excess emission in and around the core that could be due to unresolved point sources. Based on X-ray luminosities and colors, we conclude that there are 4-5 likely quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries and that most of the other sources are cataclysmic variables.

The parameters of the orbit of the postulated third body are now apparently well constrained and will allow further observations to effectively test the hypothesis that EXO 0748-676 is a triple system. The derived orbital parameters are such that, unless the inclination angle is very low, a third body in the system must have a mass less than the lower limit for a main-sequence star.},

	abstract = {Using the eclipses as fiducial markers, an updated ephemeris for EXO 0748 - 676 is derived and evidence is found that between February 1985 and March 1989 the 3.82-h orbital period of EXO 0748 - 676 decreased with a time scale of -5 x 10 to the 6th yr. The sense of this change is the same as that predicted by simple models for the evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries containing main-sequence companions, but is a factor about 100 faster than expected. This rapid change in orbital period could result from the expansion of the companion due to the effects of X-ray heating. The eclipse transition durations are variable, with the shortest observed taking 1.5 s and the longest 40 s. This latter figure is about an order of magnitude too large to be due to absorption effects in the atmosphere of the secondary assuming a Roche geometry and likely stellar temperature. Either flaring activity or the presence of an X-ray heated evaporative wind or a corona may enhance the scale height of the companion's atmosphere producing the extended eclipse transitions.},

	abstract = {The transient low-mass X-ray binary, EXO 0748-676, discovered with EXOSAT, is known to exhibit eclipses of a 492-s duration with a 3.82-hr period, intensity dips at pre-eclipse phases and type-I X-ray bursts. We observed this source with Ginga in 1989 March, 1990 December, 1991 January, and 1991 August and determined nine eclipse center times. Combining these eclipse center times with the previous result of the EXOSAT observations, we find that the orbital period of this source is not decaying monotonically, contrary to the previously reported suggestion. Instead, it shows a more complex behavior. A quadratic fit to the eclipse data yields a positive rate of change in orbital period with an approximate rate of 0.9 x 10 exp 7/yr, although the EXOSAT observations made in 1985 do not fit this trend. A sinusoidal function gives a better fit to the observed orbital period changes with a period of about 12 yr and an amplitude of about 44 lt-s, although the period is much longer than the observation interval of about 6.5 yr. Possible mechanisms for the orbital period change are discussed.},

According to our analysis, the mean orbital period has increased by ~8 ms between the pre-RXTE era (1985-1990) and the RXTE/USA era (1996-2000). This corresponds to an orbital period derivative of Porb/Porb~2×107 yr. However, neither a constant orbital period derivative nor any other simple ephemeris provides an acceptable fit to the data; individual timings of eclipse centers have residuals of up to 15 or more seconds away from our derived smooth ephemerides. When we consider all published eclipse timing data, including those presented here, a model that includes observational measurement error, cumulative period jitter, and underlying period evolution is found to be consistent with the timing data. We discuss several physical mechanisms for LMXB orbital evolution in an effort to account for the change in orbital period and the observed intrinsic jitter in the mideclipse times.},

These include both observations where an eclipse was specifically targeted and those eclipses found in the RXTE data archive. Eclipse cycle count has been maintained since the discovery of the EXO 0748-676 system in 1985 February. We describe our observing and analysis techniques for each eclipse and describe improvements we have made since the last compilation by Wolff et al. The principal result of this paper is the database containing the timing results from a seven-parameter fit to the X-ray light curve for each observed eclipse along with the associated errors in the fitted parameters. Based on the standard O - C analysis, EXO 0748-676 has undergone four distinct orbital period epochs since its discovery. In addition, EXO 0748-676 shows small-scale events in the O - C curve that are likely due to short-lived changes in the secondary star.},

	abstract = {Relativistic Lense-Thirring precession of a tilted inner accretion disk around a compact object has been proposed as a mechanism for low-frequency (~0.01-70 Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the light curves of X-ray binaries. A substantial misalignment angle (~15$\,^{\circ}$-20$\,^{\circ}$) between the inner-disk rotation axis and the compact-object spin axis is required for the effects of this precession to produce observable modulations in the X-ray light curve. A consequence of this misalignment is that in high-inclination X-ray binaries the precessing inner disk will quasi-periodically intercept our line of sight to the compact object. In the case of neutron-star systems, this should have a significant observational effect, since a large fraction of the accretion energy is released on or near the neutron-star surface. In this Letter, I suggest that this specific effect of Lense-Thirring precession may already have been observed as ~1 Hz QPOs in several dipping/eclipsing neutron-star X-ray binaries.},

The source is a faint recurrent X-ray transient initially identified by the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory. The 599 Hz (1.67 ms) pulsation had a fractional rms amplitude of 8% in the 2-20 keV range, and its shape was approximately sinusoidal. The pulses show an energy-dependent phase delay, with the 6-9 keV pulses arriving up to 85 mus earlier than those at lower energies. No X-ray bursts, dips, or eclipses were detected. The neutron star is in a circular 2.46 hr orbit with a very low-mass donor, most likely a brown dwarf. The binary parameters of the system are similar to those of the first known accreting millisecond pulsar, SAX J1808.4-3658. Assuming that the mass transfer is driven by gravitational radiation and that the 2004 outburst fluence is typical, the 3 yr recurrence time implies a distance of at least 4 kpc.},

	abstract = {Accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars are the long-sought evolutionary progenitors of ``recycled" millisecond radio pulsars. The population of these sources has grown rapidly over the last three years, with the discovery of five new examples. The latest, IGR J00291+5934, was first detected in outburst by ESA's International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) in December 2004, and was subsequently observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The neutron star in this 2.46 hr binary has the most rapid spin of the accretion-powered pulsars at 599 Hz. Two previous outbursts were detected retroactively in the RXTE All-Sky Monitor lightcurve, each three years before the next. IGR J00291+5394 is similar in almost every respect to the first accreting millisecond pulsar discovered, SAX J1808.4-3658. I will compare the properties of these two sources to the rest of the sample, and also present recent evidence for variations in the long-term accretion rate.

	abstract = {In this paper we report on our analysis of three Chandra observations of the accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J00291+5934 obtained during the late stages of the 2004 outburst. We also report the serendipitous detection of the source in quiescence by ROSAT during MJD 48830-48839 (1992 July 26-August 4). The detected 0.3-10 keV source count rates varied significantly between the Chandra observations from (7.2 +/- 1.2) × 10-3, (6.8 +/- 0.9) × 10-3 and (1.4 +/- 0.1) × 10-2 counts s-1 for the first, second and third Chandra observations, on MJD 53371.88 (2005 January 1), 53383.99 (2005 January 13) and 53407.57 (2005 February 6), respectively. The count rate for the third observation is 2.0 +/- 0.4 times as high as that of the average of the first two observations. The unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV source fluxes for the best-fitting power-law model to the source spectrum were (7.9 +/- 2.5) × 10-14, (7.3 +/- 2.0) × 10-14, and (1.17 +/- 0.22) × 10-13 erg cm-2 s-1 for the first, second and third Chandra observations, respectively. We find that this source flux is consistent with that found by ROSAT[~(5.4 +/- 2.4) × 10-14 erg cm-2 s-1]. Under the assumption that the interstellar extinction, NH, does not vary between the observations, we find that the blackbody temperature during the second Chandra observation is significantly higher than that during the first and third observations. Furthermore, the effective temperature of the neutron star derived from fitting an absorbed blackbody or neutron star atmosphere model to the data is rather high in comparison with many other neutron star soft X-ray transients in quiescence, even during the first and third observations. If we assume that the source quiescent luminosity is similar to that measured for two other accretion powered millisecond pulsars in quiescence, the distance to IGR J00291+5934 is 2.6-3.6 kpc.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous observations of the accretion-powered millisecond pulsar IGR J00291+5934 by the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer during the 2004 December outburst are analysed. The average spectrum is well described by thermal Comptonization with an electron temperature of 50 keV and Thomson optical depth tauT˜1 in a slab geometry. The spectral shape is almost constant during the outburst. For the first time we detect a spin-up, dotnu=8.4× 10-13 Hz s-1, of an accreting millisecond pulsar. The ISGRI data reveal the pulsation of X-rays at a period of 1.67 milliseconds up to ˜150 keV. The pulsed fraction is shown to increase from 6 per cent at 6 keV to 12-20 per cent at 100 keV. This is naturally explained by the action of the Doppler effect on the exponentially cutoff Comptonization spectrum from the hot spot. The nearly sinusoidal pulses show soft lags with a complex energy dependence, increasing up to 7 keV, then decreasing to 15 keV, and seemingly saturating at higher energies.},

@article{Linares07,
	abstract = {IGR J00291+5934 is one of the seven accreting millisecond pulsars (AMPs) discovered so far. We report on the aperiodic timing and color analysis of its X-ray flux, using all the RXTE observations of the 2004 outburst. Flat-top noise and two harmonically related quasi-periodic oscillations, all of them at very low frequencies (0.01-0.1 Hz), were present in the power spectra during most of the outburst as well as a very high fractional variability (~50%). These properties are atypical not only for AMPs but also for neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in general. There are instead some remarkable similarities with the variability observed in black hole systems, reinforcing the connections between these two types of LMXBs, as well as some interesting differences. We note finally that the results of this paper are difficult to reconcile with interpretations where any break frequency of power density spectra scales inversely with the mass of the central object at an accuracy sufficient to distinguish between the masses of neutron stars and black holes in LMXBs.},

@article{Torres08,
	abstract = {We report on optical and near-infrared observations obtained during and after the 2004 December discovery outburst of the X-ray transient and accretion-powered millisecond pulsar IGR J00291+5934. Our observations monitored the evolution of the brightness and the spectral properties of IGR J00291+5934 during the outburst decay toward quiescence. We also present optical, near-infrared, and Chandra observations obtained during true quiescence. Photometry of the field during outburst reveals an optical and near-infrared counterpart that brightened from R~=23 to R~=17 and from K=19 to K~=16. Spectral analysis of the RIJHK broadband photometry shows excess in the near-infrared bands that may be due to synchrotron emission. The Halpha emission line profile suggests the orbital inclination is ~=22$\,^{\circ}$-32$\,^{\circ}$. The preferred range for the reddening toward the source is 0.7<=E(B-V)<=0.9, which is equivalent to 4.06×1021 cm-2<=NH<=5.22×1021 cm-2. The Chandra observations of the pulsar in its quiescent state gave an unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux for the best-fitting power-law model to the source spectrum of (7.0+/-0.9)×10-14 ergs cm-2 s-1 (adopting a hydrogen column of 4.6×1021 cm-2). The fit resulted in a power-law photon index of 2.4+0.5-0.4. The (R-K)0 color observed during quiescence supports an irradiated donor star and accretion disk. We estimate a distance of 2-4 kpc toward IGR J00291+5934 by using the outburst X-ray light curve and the estimated critical X-ray luminosity necessary to keep the outer parts of the accretion disk ionized. Using the quiescent X-ray luminosity and the spin period, we constrain the magnetic field of the neutron star to be <3×108 G.},

IGR J00291+5934 is the first source among accretion-powered millisecond pulsars to show signs of a thermal component in its quiescent spectrum. Fitting this component with a neutron star atmosphere or a blackbody model we obtain soft temperatures (~64 and ~110 eV, respectively). As in other sources of this class a hard spectral component is also present, comprising more than 60% of the unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux. Interpreting the soft component as cooling emission from the neutron star, we can conclude that the compact object can be spun up to millisecond periods by accreting only <~0.2 Msolar.},

	abstract = {A new class of spun-up radio pulsars with short periods, long apparent ages, and pulsed optical, X-ray, and gamma ray fluxes significantly below those expected for canonical pulsars with similar periods is reported. Scenarios for the formation of such a pulsar, in which a neutron star accretes from a Keplerian accretion disk initially fed by a companion, are discussed. Because of their long spin-down lifetimes, such pulsars would probably be observable if their birth rate exceeded even 10 to the -4th that of the canonical ones. It is proposed that the recently discovered millisecond pulsar 4C21.53 belongs to this class, together with the binaries PSRs 1913+16, 0820+02, and 0655+64, as well as possibly several isolated pulsars such as PSRs 1952+29 and 1804-08.},

@article{Gavriil07,
	abstract = {We report on the serendipitous discovery of a 442 Hz pulsar during a Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observation of the globular cluster NGC 6440. The oscillation is detected following a burstlike event which was decaying at the beginning of the observation. The timescale of the decay suggests we may have seen the tail end of a long-duration burst. Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are known to emit thermonuclear X-ray bursts that are sometimes modulated by the spin frequency of the star, the so-called burst oscillations. The pulsations reported here are peculiar if interpreted as canonical burst oscillations. In particular, the pulse train lasted for ~500 s, much longer than in standard burst oscillations. The signal was highly coherent and drifted down by ~2 × 10-3 Hz, much smaller than the ~Hz drifts typically observed during normal bursts, but consistent with orbital motion of the neutron star. The pulsations are reminiscent of those observed during the much more energetic ``superbursts'' however, the temporal profile and the energetics of the burst suggest that it was not the tail end nor the precursor feature of a superburst. Rather, it is likely that we caught a portion of an outburst from a new ``intermittent'' accreting millisecond pulsar, a phenomenon which until now had only been seen in HETE J1900.1-2455.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of an episode of coherent millisecond X-ray pulsation in the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Aql X-1. The episode lasts for slightly more than 150 s, during which the pulse frequency is consistent with being constant. No X-ray burst or other evidence of thermonuclear burning activity is seen in correspondence with the pulsation, which can thus be identified as occurring in the persistent emission. The pulsation frequency is 550.27 Hz, very close (0.5 Hz higher) to the maximum reported frequency from burst oscillations in this source. Hence we identify this frequency with the neutron star spin frequency. The pulsed fraction is strongly energy dependent, ranging from <1% at 3-5 keV to >10% at 16-30 keV. We discuss possible physical interpretations and their consequences for our understanding of the lack of pulsation in most neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. If interpreted as accretion-powered pulsation, Aql X-1 might play a key role in understanding the differences between pulsating and nonpulsating sources.},

@article{Pintore15a,
	abstract = {Broad emission features of abundant chemical elements, such as iron, are commonly seen in the X-ray spectra of accreting compact objects and their studies can provide useful information about the geometry of the accretion processes. In this work, we focus our attention on GX 3+1, a bright, persistent accreting low-mass X-ray binary, classified as an atoll source. Its spectrum is well described by an accretion disc plus a stable Comptonizing, optically thick corona which dominates the X-ray emission in the 0.3-20 keV energy band. In addition, four broad emission lines are found and we associate them with reflection of hard photons from the inner regions of the accretion disc, where Doppler and relativistic effects are important. We used self-consistent reflection models to fit the spectra of the 2010 XMM-Newton observation and the stacking of the whole data sets of 2010 INTEGRAL observations. We conclude that the spectra are consistent with reflection produced at ˜10 gravitational radii by an accretion disc with an ionization parameter of xi ˜ 600 erg cm s-1 and viewed under an inclination angle of the system of ˜35$\,^{\circ}$. Furthermore, we detected for the first time for GX 3+1, the presence of a power-law component dominant at energies higher than 20 keV, possibly associated with an optically thin component of non-thermal electrons.},

@article{DAi15,
	abstract = {The bursting pulsar, GRO J1744-28, went again in outburst after ˜18 yr of quiescence in 2014 mid-January. We studied the broad-band, persistent, X-ray spectrum using X-ray data from a XMM-Newton observation, performed almost at the peak of the outburst, and from a close INTEGRAL observation, performed 3 d later, thus covering the 1.3-70.0 keV band. The spectrum shows a complex continuum shape that cannot be modelled with standard high-mass X-ray pulsar models, nor by two-components models. We observe broad-band and peaked residuals from 4 to 15 keV, and we propose a self-consistent interpretation of these residuals, assuming they are produced by cyclotron absorption features and by a moderately smeared, highly ionized, reflection component. We identify the cyclotron fundamental at ˜4.7 keV, with hints for two possible harmonics at ˜10.4 and ˜15.8 keV. The position of the cyclotron fundamental allows an estimate for the pulsar magnetic field of (5.27 $\pm$ 0.06) × 1011 G, if the feature is produced at its surface. From the dynamical and relativistic smearing of the disc reflected component, we obtain a lower limit estimate for the truncated accretion disc inner radius (≳100 Rg) and for the inclination angle (18$\,^{\circ}$-48$\,^{\circ}$). We also detect the presence of a softer thermal component that we associate with the emission from an accretion disc truncated at a distance from the pulsar of 50-115 Rg. From these estimates, we derive the magnetospheric radius for disc accretion to be ˜0.2 times the classical Alfv{\'e}n radius for radial accretion.},

@article{Pintore14,
	abstract = {When the EPIC-pn instrument on board XMM-Newton is operated in Timing mode, high count rates (>100 counts s-1) of bright sources may affect the calibration of the energy scale, resulting in a modification of the real spectral shape. The corrections related to this effect are then strongly important in the study of the spectral properties. Tests of these calibrations are more suitable in sources which spectra are characterized by a large number of discrete features. Therefore, in this work, we carried out a spectral analysis of the accreting neutron star GX 13+1, which is a dipping source with several narrow absorption lines and a broad emission line in its spectrum. We tested two different correction approaches on an XMM-Newton EPIC-pn observation taken in Timing mode: the standard rate-dependent charge transfer inefficiency (RDCTI or epfast) and the new, rate-dependent pulse height amplitude (RDPHA) corrections. We found that, in general, the two corrections marginally affect the properties of the overall broad-band continuum, while hints of differences in the broad emission line spectral shape are seen. On the other hand, they are dramatically important for the centroid energy of the absorption lines. In particular, the RDPHA corrections provide a better estimate of the spectral properties of these features than the RDCTI corrections. Indeed the discrete features observed in the data, applying the former method, are physically more consistent with those already found in other Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of GX 13+1.},

	abstract = {Both the broad iron (Fe) line and the frequency of the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) in neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) can potentially provide independent measures of the inner radius of the accretion disc. We use XMM-Newton and simultaneous Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the LMXB 4U 1636-53 to test this hypothesis. We study the properties of the Fe Kalpha emission line as a function of the spectral state of the source and the frequency of the kHz QPOs. We find that the inner radius of the accretion disc deduced from the frequency of the upper kHz QPO varies as a function of the position of the source in the colour-colour diagram, in accordance with previous work and with the standard scenario of accretion disc geometry. On the contrary, the inner disc radius deduced from the profile of the iron line is not correlated with the spectral state of the source. The values of the inner radius inferred from kHz QPOs and iron lines, in four observations, do not lead to a consistent value of the neutron star mass, regardless of the model used to fit the iron line.  Our results suggest that either the kHz QPO or the standard relativistic Fe line interpretation does not apply for this system. Furthermore, the simultaneous detection of kHz QPOs and broad iron lines is difficult to reconcile with models in which the broadening of the iron line is due to the reprocessing of photons in an outflowing wind.},

	abstract = {We used six simultaneous XMM-Newton and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer plus five Suzaku observations to study the continuum spectrum and the iron emission line in the neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53. We modelled the spectra with two thermal components (representing the accretion disc and boundary layer), a Comptonized component (representing a hot corona), and either a Gaussian or a relativistic line component to model an iron emission line at ˜6.5 keV. For the relativistic line component, we used either the DISKLINE, LAOR or KYRLINE model, the latter for three different values of the spin parameter. The fitting results for the continuum are consistent with the standard truncated disc scenario. We also find that the flux and equivalent width of the iron line first increase and then decrease as the flux of the Comptonized component increases. This could be explained either by changes in the ionization state of the accretion disc where the line is produced by reflection, or by light bending of the emission from the Comptonized component if the height at which this component is produced changes with mass accretion rate.},

	abstract = {We present a systematic analysis of the complete set of observations of the black hole (BH) binary XTE J1550-564 obtained by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We study the fast time variability properties of the source and determine the spin of the BH through the relativistic precession model. Similarly to what is observed in the BH binary GRO J1655-40, the frequencies of the QPOs and broad-band noise components match the general relativistic frequencies of particle motion close to the compact object predicted by the relativistic precession model. The combination of two simultaneously observed quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequencies together with the dynamical BH mass from optical/infrared observations yields a spin equal to a = 0.34 $\pm$ 0.01, consistent with previous determinations from X-ray spectroscopy. Based on the derived BH parameters, the low-frequency QPO emission radii vary from ˜30 gravitational radii (Rg) to the innermost stable orbit for this spin (˜5 Rg), where they sharply disappear as observed for the case of GRO J1655-40.},

	abstract = {We measured the phase-lag spectrum of the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) in the black hole systems (at QPO frequencies) GRS 1915+105 (35 Hz and 67 Hz), GRO J1655-40 (300 Hz and 450 Hz), XTE J1550-564 (180 Hz and 280 Hz) and IGR J17091-3624 (67 Hz). The lag spectra of the 67-Hz QPO in, respectively, GRS 1915+105 and IGR J17091-3624, and the 450-Hz QPO in GRO J1655-40 are hard (hard photons lag the soft ones) and consistent with each other, with the hard lags increasing with energy. On the contrary, the lags of the 35- Hz QPO in GRS 1915+105 are soft, with the lags becoming softer as the energy increases; the lag spectrum of the 35-Hz QPO is inconsistent with that of the 67-Hz QPO. The lags of the 300-Hz QPO in GRO J1655-40, and the 180-Hz and the 280-Hz QPO in XTE J1550-564 are independent of energy, consistent with each other and with being zero or slightly positive (hard lags). For GRO J1655-40, the lag spectrum of the 300-Hz QPO differs significantly from that of the 450-Hz QPOs. The similarity of the lag spectra of the 180-Hz and 280-Hz QPO in XTE J1550-564 suggests that these two are the same QPO seen at a different frequency in different observations. If this is correct, the lags could provide an alternative way to identify the high-frequency QPO features in galactic black hole systems. The lag spectrum of the 67-Hz QPO in GRS 1915+105 (hard lags) is significantly different from that of the 2.7 × 10-4 Hz QPO in the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy RE J1034+396 (soft lags), which disproves the suggestion that the two QPOs are the same physical phenomenon with their frequencies scaled only by the black hole mass. The lag spectrum of the QPO in RE J1034+396 is similar to that of the 35-Hz QPO in GRS 1915+105, although identifying these two QPOs as being the same physical feature remains problematic. We compare our results with those for the lags of the kilohertz QPOs in neutron-star systems and the broad-band noise component in active galactic nuclei, and discuss possible scenarios for producing the lags in these systems.},

	abstract = {We studied the energy and frequency dependence of the Fourier time lags and intrinsic coherence of the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) in the neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries 4U 1608-52 and 4U 1636-53, using a large data set obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We confirmed that, in both sources, the time lags of the lower kHz QPO are soft and their magnitude increases with energy. We also found that: (i) In 4U 1636-53, the soft lags of the lower kHz QPO remain constant at ˜ 30 mus in the QPO frequency range 500-850 Hz, and decrease to ˜ 10 mus when the QPO frequency increases further. In 4U 1608-52, the soft lags of the lower kHz QPO remain constant at 40 mus up to 800 Hz, the highest frequency reached by this QPO in our data. (ii) In both sources, the time lags of the upper kHz QPO are hard, independent of energy or frequency and inconsistent with the soft lags of the lower kHz QPO. (iii) In both sources the intrinsic coherence of the lower kHz QPO remains constant at ˜0.6 between 5 and 12 keV, and drops to zero above that energy. The intrinsic coherence of the upper kHz QPO is consistent with being zero across the full energy range. (iv) In 4U 1636-53, the intrinsic coherence of the lower kHz QPO increases from ˜0 at ˜600 Hz to ˜1, and it decreases to ˜0.5 at 920 Hz; in 4U 1608-52, the intrinsic coherence is consistent with the same trend. (v) In both sources the intrinsic coherence of the upper kHz QPO is consistent with zero over the full frequency range of the QPO, except in 4U 1636-53 between 700 and 900 Hz where the intrinsic coherence marginally increases. We discuss our results in the context of scenarios in which the soft lags are either due to reflection off the accretion disc or up-/down-scattering in a hot medium close to the neutron star. We finally explore the connection between, on one hand the time lags and the intrinsic coherence of the kHz QPOs, and on the other the QPOs' amplitude and quality factor in these two sources.},

	abstract = {We present the results of the analysis of a large data base of X-ray observations of 22 galactic black hole transients with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer throughout its operative life for a total exposure time of ˜12 ms. We excluded persistent systems and the peculiar source GRS 1915+105, as well as the most recently discovered sources. The semi-automatic homogeneous analysis was aimed at the detection of high-frequency (100-1000 Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO), of which several cases were previously reported in the literature. After taking into account the number of independent trials, we obtained 11 detections from two sources only: XTE J1550-564 and GRO J1655-40. For the former, the detected frequencies are clustered around 180  and 280 Hz, as previously found. For the latter, the previously reported dichotomy 300-450 Hz is found to be less sharp. We discuss our results in comparison with kHz QPO in neutron-star X-ray binaries and the prospects for future timing X-ray missions.},

@article{Sanna13,
	abstract = {We analysed the X-ray spectra of six observations, simultaneously taken with XMM-Newton and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), of the neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53. The observations cover several states of the source, and therefore a large range of inferred mass accretion rate. These six observations show a broad emission line in the spectrum at around 6.5 keV, likely due to iron. We fitted this line with a set of phenomenological models of a relativistically broadened line, plus a model that accounts for relativistically smeared and ionized reflection from the accretion disc. The latter model includes the incident emission from both the neutron-star surface or boundary layer and the corona that is responsible for the high-energy emission in these systems. From the fits with the reflection model we found that in four out of the six observations the main contribution to the reflected spectrum comes from the neutron-star surface or boundary layer, whereas in the other two observations the main contribution to the reflected spectrum comes from the corona. We found that the relative contribution of these two components is not correlated to the state of the source. From the phenomenological models, we found that the iron line profile is better described by a symmetric, albeit broad, profile. The width of the line cannot be explained only by Compton broadening, and we therefore explored the case of relativistic broadening. We further found that the direct emission from the disc, boundary layer and corona generally evolved in a manner consistent with the standard accretion disc model, with the disc and boundary layer becoming hotter and the disc moving inwards as the source changed from the hard to the soft state. The iron line, however, did not appear to follow the same trend.},

@article{Wijnands06,
	abstract = {We present the first results of our X-ray monitoring campaign on a 1.7 square degree region centered on Sgr A* using the satellites XMM-Newton and Chandra. The purpose of this campaign is to monitor the behavior (below 10 keV) of X-ray sources (both persistent and transient) which are too faint to be detected by monitoring instruments aboard other satellites currently in orbit (e.g., Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer; INTEGRAL). Our first monitoring observations (using the HRC-I aboard Chandra) were obtained on June 5, 2005. Most of the sources detected could be identified with foreground sources, such as X-ray active stars. In addition we detected two persistent X-ray binaries (1E 1743.1-2843; 1A 1742-294), two faint X-ray transients (GRS 1741.9-2853; XMM J174457-2850.3), as well as a possible new transient source at a luminosity of a few times 1034 erg s-1. We report on the X-ray results on these systems and on the non-detection of the transients in follow-up radio data using the Very Large Array. We discuss how our monitoring campaign can help to improve our understanding of the different types of X-ray transients (i.e., the very faint ones).},

	abstract = {Aims: On 28 February 2007 a new outburst of the previously known transient source XTE J1856+053 was detected with RXTE/ASM. We present here the results of an XMM-Newton (0.5-10.0 keV) Target of Opportunity observation performed on 14 March 2007, aimed at constraining the mass of the compact object in this X-ray binary and determining its main properties.  Methods: The EPIC-pn camera was used in Timing mode and its spectrum fit together with the RGS data. IR observations with GROND at the 2.2 m telescope in La Silla provide further information on the system.  Results: The X-ray light curve shows that both the 1996 and the 2007 outbursts had two peaks. The X-ray spectrum is well fit with a thermal accretion disk model, with kT_in = 0.75($\pm$0.01) keV and foreground absorption N{H} = 4.5($\pm$0.1)×1022 cm-2. The low disk temperature favours a black-hole as accreting object, with an estimated mass in the range 1.3-4.2 M&sun;. From the IR upper limits we argue that XTE J1856+053 is a low mass X-ray binary. We estimate the orbital period of the system to be between 3 and 12 h.

	abstract = {During the 2008 September-October outburst of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658, the source was observed by both Suzaku and XMM-Newton approximately 1 day apart. Spectral analysis reveals a broad relativistic Fe Kalpha emission line which is present in both data sets, as has recently been reported for other neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. The properties of the Fe K line observed during each observation are very similar. From modeling the Fe line, we determine the inner accretion disk radius to be 13.2 $\pm$ 2.5 GM c-2. The inner disk radius measured from the Fe K line suggests that the accretion disk is not very receded in the hard state. If the inner disk (as measured by the Fe line) is truncated at the magnetospheric radius this implies a magnetic field strength of ~3 × 108 G at the magnetic poles, consistent with other independent estimates.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of BeppoSAX observations of the unique transient bursting X-ray pulsar GRO J1744-28. The observations took place in March 1997 during the decay phase of the outburst. We find that the persistent broadband X-ray continuum of the source is consistent with a cutoff power law typical for the accreting pulsars. We also detect the fluorescence iron line at 6.7 keV and an absorption feature at ~4.5 keV, which we interpret as a cyclotron line. The corresponding magnetic field strength in the line forming region is ~3.7 x 10^11 G. Neither line is detected in the spectra of the bursts. However, additional soft thermal component with kT ~2 keV was required to describe the burst spectrum. We briefly discuss the nature of this component and argue that among other possibilities it might be connected with thermonuclear flashes at the neutron star surface which accompany the accretion-powered bursts in the source.},

	abstract = {The large majority of neutron stars (NSs) in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) have never shown detectable pulsations despite several decades of intense monitoring. The reason for this remains an unsolved problem that hampers our ability to measure the spin frequency of most accreting NSs. The accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) HETE J1900.1-2455 is an intermittent pulsar that exhibited pulsations at about 377 Hz for the first two months and then turned into a nonpulsating source. Understanding why this happened might help us to understand why most LMXBs do not pulsate. We present a seven-year coherent timing analysis of data taken with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We discover new sporadic pulsations that are detected on a baseline of about 2.5 years. We find that the pulse phases anti-correlate with the X-ray flux as previously discovered in other AMXPs. We place stringent upper limits of 0.05% rms on the pulsed fraction when pulsations are not detected and identify an enigmatic pulse phase drift of ~180$\,^{\circ}$ in coincidence with the first disappearance of pulsations. Thanks to the new pulsations we measure a long term spin frequency derivative whose strength decays exponentially with time. We interpret this phenomenon as evidence of magnetic field burial.},

	abstract = {We present an analytical formula for the position and shape of the spots on the surface of accreting magnetized stars in cases where a star has a dipole magnetic field tilted at a small misalignment angle Theta ≲ 30$\,^{\circ}$ about the rotational axis, and the magnetosphere is 2.5-5 times the radius of the star. We observed that the azimuthal position of the spots varies significantly when the position of the inner disc varies. In contrast, the polar position of the spots varies only slightly because of the compression of the magnetosphere. The azimuthal width of the spots strongly varies with Theta: spots have the shape of an arc at larger misalignment angles, and resemble a ring at very small misalignment angles. The polar width of the spots varies only slightly with changes in parameters. The motion of the spots in the azimuthal direction can provide phase-shifts in accreting millisecond pulsars, and the `drift' of the period in Classical T Tauri stars. The position and shape of the spots are determined by three parameters: misalignment angle Theta; normalized corotation radius, rc/R*, and normalized magnetospheric radius, rm/R*, where R* is the stellar radius. We also use our data to check the formula for the Alfv{\'e}n radius, where the main dependences are rm˜(mu2/M&sun;)2/7, where mu is the magnetic moment of the star, and M&sun; is the accretion rate. We found that the dependence is more gradual, rm ˜ (mu2/M&sun;)1/5, which can be explained by the compression of the magnetosphere by the disc matter and by the non-dipole shape of the magnetic field lines of the external magnetosphere.},

	abstract = {We report our analysis of a Chandra X-ray observation of the rich globular cluster Terzan 5, in which we detect 50 sources to a limiting 1.0-6 keV X-ray luminosity of 3×1031 ergs s-1 within the half-mass radius of the cluster. Thirty-three of these have LX>1032 ergs s-1, the largest number yet seen in any globular cluster. In addition to the quiescent low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB; identified by Wijnands et al.), another 12 relatively soft sources may be quiescent LMXBs. We compare the X-ray colors of the harder sources in Terzan 5 to the Galactic center sources studied by Muno and collaborators and find the Galactic center sources to have harder X-ray colors, indicating a possible difference in the populations. We cannot clearly identify a metallicity dependence in the production of low-luminosity X-ray binaries in Galactic globular clusters, but a metallicity dependence of the form suggested by Jord{\'a}n et al. for extragalactic LMXBs is consistent with our data.},

@article{Burderi02,
	abstract = {We report here the results of a 90 ks BeppoSAX observation of the low-mass X-ray binary and atoll source KS 1731-260 during a quiescent phase. From this observation we derive a source X-ray luminosity of ~1033 ergs s-1 (for a source distance of 7 kpc). If the neutron star is spinning at a period of a few milliseconds, as inferred from the nearly coherent oscillations observed during type I X-ray bursts, the quiescent X-ray luminosity constrains the neutron star magnetic field strength. We consider all the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the quiescent X-ray emission of neutron star X-ray transients and compare the corresponding expectations with the measured upper limit on the X-ray luminosity. We find that, in any case, the neutron star magnetic field is most probably less than ~109 G. We have also observed KS 1731-260, still in its quiescent state, at 1.4 GHz with the Parkes radio telescope to search for radio pulses. We found that no radio signals with millisecond periods are present with an upper limit on the flux of 0.60 mJy using a 4 minute integration time (optimal for a close system with an orbital period smaller than a few hours) and of 0.21 mJy using a 35 minute integration time (optimal for a wide-orbit system).},

X-ray binaries, consisting of a highly magnetized neutron star and a stellar companion, originate X-ray emission according to the energy of the accretion matter onto the neutron star. The accretion matter also transfers the angular momentum at the Alfven radius, and then spin up the neutron star. Therefore, the X-ray luminosity and the spin-up rate are supposed to be well correlated. We analyzed the luminosity and period-change relation using the data taken by continuous monitoring of MAXI/GSC and Fermi/GBM for Be/X-ray binaries, GX 304$-$1, A 0535$+$26, GRO J1008$-$57, KS 1947$+$300, and 2S 1417$-$624, which occurred large outbursts in the last four years. We discuss the results comparing the obtained observed relation with that of the theoretical model by Ghosh \& Lamb (1979).},

To reduce systematic errors, we perform an accurate inflight calibration of the instrument, producing an improved description of the mask pattern, time-dependent pixel equalization maps, boresight misalignment correction, and energy dependent off-axis count rate correction.

The meteorite data are generally accurate to + or - 5-10 percent. Significant discrepancies between the sun and meteorites occur only for Fe, Mn, Ge, Pb, and W; other well-determined elements agree to + or - 9 percent on the average. There is no evidence for group fractionations in C1 chondrites of cosmochemically similar elements (refractories, siderophiles, volatiles, etc.), but a selective fractionation of Fe cannot be ruled out. Abundances of odd-A nuclides between A = 65 and 209 show a generally smooth trend, with elemental abundances conforming to the slope defined by isotopic abundances. Significant irregularities occur in the Nd-Sm-Eu region, however, suggesting that the abundance curve is dependably smooth only down to about 20 percent level.},

@article{DAi10,
	abstract = {Context. High-resolution spectroscopy has recently revealed in many low-mass X-ray binaries hosting a neutron star that the shape of the broad iron line observed in the 6.4-6.97 keV range is consistently well-fitted by a relativistically smeared line profile.  Aims: The presence of other broad features, besides the iron line, together with a high S/N of the spectra offer the possibility of testing a self-consistent approach to the overall broadband reflection spectrum and evaluating the impact of the reflection component in the formation of the broadband X-ray spectra.  Methods: We analyzed two XMM-Newton observations of the bright atoll source 4U 1705-44, which can be considered a prototype of the class of the persistent NS LMXBs showing both hard and soft states. The first observation was performed when the source was in a hard low flux state, the second during a soft, high-flux state. Both the spectra show broad iron emission lines. We fit the spectra using a two-component model, together with a reflection model specifically suited to the case of a neutron star, where the incident spectrum has a blackbody shape.  Results: In the soft state, the reflection model, convolved with a relativistic smearing component, consistently describes the broad features present in the spectrum, and we find a clear relation between the temperature of the incident flux and the temperature of the harder X-ray component that we interpret as the boundary layer emission. In this state we find converging evidence that the boundary layer outer radius is ~2 times the neutron star radius. In the low flux state, we observe a change in the continuum shape of the spectrum with respect to the soft state. Still, the broad local emission features can be associated with a disk reflecting matter, but in a lower ionization state, and possibly produced in an accretion disk truncated at greater distance.  Conclusions: Our analysis provides strong evidence that the reflection component in soft states of LMXBs comes from to hard X-ray thermal irradiation, which we identify with the boundary layer emission, also present in the continuum model. In the hard state, the broad iron line if also produced by reflection, and the continuum disk emission can be self-consistently accounted if the disk is truncated at a greater distance than the soft state.

@article{Bildsten97b,
	abstract = {We summarize 5 years of continuous monitoring of accretion-powered pulsars with the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Our 20-70 keV observations have determined or refined the orbital parameters of 13 binaries, discovered five new transient accreting pulsars, measured the pulsed flux history during outbursts of 12 transients (GRO J1744-28, 4U 0115+634, GRO J1750-27, GS 0834-430, 2S 1417-624, GRO J1948+32, EXO 2030+375, GRO J1008-57, A0535+26, GRO J2058+42, 4U 1145-619, and A1118-616), and also measured the accretion torque history during outbursts of six of those transients whose orbital parameters were also known. We have also continuously measured the pulsed flux and spin frequency for eight persistently accreting pulsars (Her X-1, Cen X-3, Vela X-1, OAO 1657-415, GX 301-2, 4U 1626-67, 4U 1538-52, and GX 1+4). Because of their continuity and uniformity over a long baseline, BATSE observations have provided new insights into the long-term behavior of accreting magnetic neutron stars. We have found that all accreting pulsars show stochastic variations in their spin frequencies and luminosities, including those displaying secular spin-up or spin-down on long timescales, which blurs the conventional distinction between disk-fed and wind-fed binaries. Pulsed flux and accretion torque are strongly correlated in outbursts of transient accreting pulsars but are uncorrelated, or even anticorrelated, in persistent sources. We describe daily folded pulse profiles, frequency, and flux measurements that are available through the Compton Observatory Science Support Center at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.},

From knowledge of the lunar topography and Earth, Moon, and spacecraft ephemerides at the epoch of the event, we determined the source position with an accuracy of 40 mas (1sigma c.l.), which is interesting, given the very poor imaging capabilities of RXTE (~1$\,^{\circ}$). For the first time, using a non-imaging X-ray observatory, the position of an X-ray source with a subarcsecond accuracy is derived, demonstrating the neat capabilities of a technique that can be fruitfully applied to current and future X-ray missions.},

@article{Burderi13,
	abstract = {The detection, in 1998, of the first Accreting Millisecond Pulsar, started an exiciting season of continuing discoveries in the fashinating field of compact binary systems harbouring a neutron star. Indeed, in these last three lustres, thanks to the extraordinary performances of astronomical detectors, on ground as well as on board of satellites, mainly in the radio, optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray bands, astrophysicists had the opportunity to thoroughly investigate the so-called Recycling Scenario: the evolutionary path leading to the formation of a Millisecond Radio Pulsar. The most intriguing phase is certainly the spin-up stage during which, because of the accretion of matter and angular momentum, the neutron star accumulates an extraordinary amount of mechanical rotational energy, up to 1% of its whole rest-mass energy. These millisecond spinning neutron stars are truly extreme physical objects: General and Special Relativity are fully in action, since their surfaces, attaining speeds close to one fifth of the speed of light, are located just beyond their Schwartzscild Radius, and electrodynamical forces, caused by the presence of huge surface magnetic fields of several hundred million Gauss, display their spectacular properties accelerating electrons up to such energies to promote pair creation in a cascade process responsible for the emission in Radio and Gamma-ray. The rotational energy is swiftly converted and released into electromagnetic power which, in some cases, causes the neutron star to outshine with a luminosity of one hundred suns. Along these fifteen years, a fruitful collaboration was established, at the Rome Astronomical Observatory, between my group and Franca D'Antona: her profound knowledge of the complex phases of stellar evolution, in particular of low-mass stars in close binary systems, was the key ingredient which boosted our theoretical and experimental studies of different evolutionary stages of these intriguing and fashinating systems. In this paper I will review some of the most recent discoveries on (accreting) millisecond pulsars, highlighting the role played by our proficuous collaboration.},

	abstract = {AN UNUSUAL astronomical source of hard X-ray bursts, GRO J1744 - 28, was discovered recently1,2. The properties of this source differ markedly from those of other known high-energy burst sources-X-ray bursters, soft gamma-ray repeaters and gamma-ray bursters- suggesting that it may represent a new type of source. The bursts probably arise from unstable accretion of matter onto a compact object2, such as a neutron star, but the nature of the object and the origin of the burst instability have not been revealed by observations of the bursts themselves. Here we report the detection of coherent X-ray pulsations, with a period of 467 milliseconds, from GRO J1744 - 28; these are the first persistent pulsations seen in a bursting X-ray source. These pulses and their timing indicate that the object is a magnetized neutron star, accreting gas from a low-mass companion star. The pulsation rate has been increasing during the period of our observations, indicating that an accretion disk has been formed and that the transfer of matter from the disk is spinning up the neutron star. The source of the instability that leads to the bursts remains unknown.},

We explore a picture in which the bursts are due to thermonuclear flashes in matter that has accreted onto the neutron star. We attribute the unusually hard spectra of the bursts and the high burst rate compared to normal Type I X-ray burst sources -- indeed the existence of unstable nuclear burning itself -- to the unusually strong surface magnetic field, $ B_s \approx 1 \times 10^{13}$ G, of the neutron star.},

@article{Lewin96,
	abstract = {Twenty years ago, the Rapid Burster (MXB 1730-335) was discovered. Its most salient feature was the occurrence of rapidly repetitive type II X-ray bursts, the release of gravitational potential energy due to spasmodic accretion onto a compact object. This is almost certainly due to an accretion disk instability whose origin is still not understood. With the recent appearance of GRO J1744-28, the Rapid Burster is no longer the only system to produce such bursts. Both systems are transient low-mass X-ray binaries in which the accretor is a neutron star. The Rapid Burster, located in a globular cluster, also produces type I bursts which are due to thermonuclear flashes on the neutron star's surface; no X-ray pulsations are observed. Its neutron star magnetic field is therefore relatively weak. In contrast, strong X-ray pulsations have been observed in the persistent flux as well as in the type II bursts from GRO J1744-28, but no type I bursts have been observed. Thus, the magnetic field of the neutron star in this system is probably stronger than is the case of the Rapid Burster. The fact that type II bursts occur in both systems may bring us closer to an understanding of the mechanism(s?) that produces them.},

	abstract = {We report OSSE observations of the bursting X-ray pulsar GRO J1744-28 made in 1995 December and 1996 January at hard X-ray energies >35 keV. The pulse profile of the persistent (i.e., nonbursting) pulsar emission is fitted with a sinusoid in the energy range 35--90 keV. Residuals reveal a second harmonic amplitude of 3.0% +/- 0.5% of the fundamental. The distribution of time intervals between bursts measured in January is characterized by a broad flat-topped function with width ~=35 minutes and mean ~=33 minutes. The burst profile averaged over an ensemble of 104 bursts in the 35--60 keV energy range has FWHM width of 3.6 +/- 0.3 s and displays a factor of 2 faster rise time than decay and a pronounced dip in persistent emission after the burst. The phase of the sinusoidal pulse profile during bursts lags the phase prior to bursts by ~=90 ms (~=1.2 radians), and a 29 +/- 6 ms (0.39 +/- 0.08 radians) lag persists following the burst. There are no statistically significant spectral differences between the hard X-ray spectra of the bursting and persistent emission in the OSSE energy range, nor is there any evidence of annihilation or neutron capture line emission or cyclotron absorption.},

Specifically, we study the global, time-dependent evolution of the Lightman-Eardley instability, which can develop near the inner edge of an accretion disk when the radiation pressure becomes comparable to the gas pressure. Broadly speaking, our results are compatible with earlier works by Taam & Lin and by Lasota & Pelat. The uniqueness of GRO J1744-28 appears to be associated with the constraint that, in order for outbursts to occur, the rate of accretion at the inner edge must be within a narrow range just above the critical accretion rate at which radiation pressure is beginning to become significant.},

@article{Miller96,
	abstract = {The X-ray pulsar GRO J1744-28 accretes so rapidly that the gas flow onto its magnetic poles should be decelerated by radiation forces rather than gas pressure gradients. The vertical scale of the deceleration region, where the bulk of the flow's kinetic energy is transformed to radiation, is large compared to the size of the accretion flow's footprint on the stellar surface, and radiation escapes in a fan beam through the sides of the decelerating gas column. If one assumes that the X-ray bursts observed from GRO J1744-28 are triggered in the accretion disk, this picture of the accretion column geometry and a consideration of the interaction between the disk and the stellar magnetic field at the magnetospheric boundary lead to a natural explanation for the phase lags of the X-ray pulses observed during bursts: The accretion column is not round but flattened, so its footprint forms an arc on the stellar surface close to the magnetic pole. The broad side of the arc faces the magnetic pole. When the accretion rate rises, the gas flow shifts to a different set of field lines, and the accretion footprint pivots through a moderate angle around the magnetic pole. Although the footprint has remained close to the magnetic pole, the direction it faces has changed. The time of pulse maximum, when an observer sees the broad side of the accretion column most face-on, changes accordingly, and a phase-lag results.},

The observations were made from 1996 January through May with the proportional counter array on the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer spacecraft. In the 2--10 keV band, GRO J1744-28 emitted large bursts of ~10 s duration at a rate of about 2 per hour. The peak flux during these bursts was ~6--40 times greater than that in the quiescent, or nonbursting, periods. For the earliest bursts, the inferred peak luminosity approaches 100 times the Eddington limit, which is suggestive of some kind of beaming mechanism. A range of smaller bursts and quasi-periodic oscillation features were also seen. All this activity was superposed on an almost perfect sinusoidal modulation at a frequency of 2.14 Hz with an amplitude of ~10% of the nonbursting flux. The source's persistent flux declined in a roughly linear trend from late January until mid-May, by which time its intensity was confused with several other sources.},

It also produces type II X-ray bursts similar to those seen in the Rapid Burster. In this Letter we report results from a series of observations with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) during which GRO J1744-28 showed quasi-periodic X-ray brightness oscillations (QPOs) at 20, 40, and 60 Hz. Their fractional rms amplitudes are 0.19%, 5.9%, and 0.42%, respectively. The QPO centroid frequency and its rms amplitude as a function of source brightness in the band of 2--60 keV indicate that these QPOs are of a different kind from the beat-frequency QPOs that have been observed among Z sources as well as X-ray pulsars. We discuss possible interpretations of these QPOs in the context of neutron star g-mode oscillations and photon bubble oscillations.},

@article{Klein96,
	abstract = {We discuss our recent Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations of GRO J1744-28, which discovered quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of the intensities in the energy band 3--12 keV during observations starting on 1996 January 18.77 UT. We have found that the power spectrum in the frequency band 5--1000 Hz consists of two red-noise components that can be characterized by two power laws, each with an index of -5/3 and a QPO peak centered at 40 Hz. We suggest that the power peak is due to a newly discovered form of turbulence in the accretion column of super-Eddington accretion-powered pulsars driven by photon bubble instabilities. These instabilities give rise to strong power peaks at frequencies characteristic of photon diffusion and bubble coalescence in the highly nonlaminar accretion column resulting in photon bubble oscillations (PBOs). The relationship between the rms amplitude of the PBOs and the intensity is in qualitative agreement with observations. Our calculations also suggest that the observed high-frequency red-noise component with a -5/3 power-law index from 40 to 600 Hz is the first evidence of photon bubble turbulence in the accretion column of an X-ray pulsar. Recent RXTE observations of Sco X-1 have found high-frequency QPOs at 1100 and 830 Hz. We show that PBOs at these frequencies are a natural consequence of photon bubble instabilities. We also show that the rms amplitudes of the calculated PBOs at these frequencies are consistent with the observations. We predict that further RXTE observations of Sco X-1 should reveal additional PBOs at 2000 and 2600 Hz as well as a broadband continuum spectrum with a -5/3 power law, extending from 3000 to several times 104 Hz.},

@article{Stark96,
	abstract = {We observe glitches in the arrival times of X-ray pulses from GRO J1744-28 associated with the large X-ray bursts observed from this source. In early observations, the pulse arrival time becomes delayed by 28 ms (6% of the 467 ms pulsar period) following bursts while the shape of the nearly sinusoidal light curve is essentially unchanged. This arrival-time lag decays exponentially over the next ~1000 s. In later observations, the observed phase lags are smaller, and eventually, some bursts appear to be accompanied by a small phase advance. While explanations of these observations that rely upon changes in the postburst accretion flow are natural, our observations present some problems for these explanations. It may be that this behavior can be understood by analogy with glitches in spinning-down radio pulsars, though this explanation has its own problems. Explained as a glitch, the phase shift is the result of coupling of the neutron star's crust to the crustal superfluid, which is spun up more slowly than the rest of the star, and the recovery is due to coupling between the crust and the core of the neutron star.},

	abstract = {We investigate the thermal stability of nuclear burning on the accreting X-ray pulsar GRO J1744-28. The neutron star's dipolar magnetic field is <~3 × 1011 G if persistent spin-up implies that the magnetospheric radius is less than the corotation radius. Bildsten earlier noted that magnetic fields this weak might not quench the vigorous convection sometimes associated with thermonuclear instabilities, so that a convective burning front can propagate around the star in a few seconds and rapidly release the accumulated nuclear energy. After inferring the properties of the neutron star, we study the thermal stability of hydrogen/helium burning and show that thermonuclear instabilities are unlikely causes of the hourly bursts seen at very high accretion rates. Then we discuss how the stability of the thermonuclear burning depends on both the global accretion rate and the neutron star's magnetic field strength. If the accreted matter spreads over the star prior to ignition, then the burning will become unstable when the accretion rate is below 6 × 10-9 M&sun; yr-1. We emphasize that the appearance of the instability (i.e., whether it looks like a type I X-ray burst or a flare lasting a few minutes) will yield crucial information on the neutron star's surface magnetic field and the role of magnetic fields in convection.  We suggest that a thermal instability in the accretion disk is the origin of the long (~300 days) outburst and that the recurrence time of these outbursts is more than 50 yr. We also discuss the nature of the binary and point out that a velocity measurement of the stellar companion (most likely a Roche lobe filling giant with mK >~ 17) will constrain the neutron star mass. This is of interest in this binary, where the inferred low mass of the companion implies that 0.5 M&sun; of transfer occurred.},

These data were taken with the Astrophysical Research Consortium's 3.5 m telescope at Apache Point Observatory and with the 2.2 m telescope at the European Southern Observatory. We see no new object, or any significant brightening of any known object, in these error circles, with the exception of an object detected in our 1996 February 8 image. This object has already been proposed as a near-infrared counterpart to GRO J1744-28. While it is seen in only two of our 10 frames from February 8, there is no evidence that this is an instrumental artifact, suggesting the possibility of near-infrared flares from GRO J1744-28, similar to those that have been reported from the Rapid Burster. The distance to the Bursting Pulsar must be more than 2 kpc, and we suggest that it is more than 7 kpc.},

	abstract = {We examine recent time-dependent accretion disk calculations by Cannizzo that attempt to reproduce the giant bursts in GRO J1744-28 and find that the fluctuations that precede the main burst resemble the fluctuations that were observed in GRO J1744-28 toward the end of the time during which the giant bursts were seen. The calculations by Cannizzo were tuned to be at a rate of accretion slightly greater than the critical rate Mcrit that divides steady and bursting behavior. This tuning leads to a near balance between the heating and cooling rates within the accretion disk such that oscillations slowly develop and grow, eventually becoming unbounded and producing a global instability. The fact that an increase in the amplitude of the interburst oscillations was seen in GRO J1744-28 most strongly during the late epoch of the time of several months covering the giant bursts is consistent with the mass accretion rate onto the pulsar decreasing and approaching Mcrit.},

@article{Kommers97,
	abstract = {The repetitive X-ray bursts from the accretion-powered pulsar GRO J1744-28 show similarities to the type II X-ray bursts from the Rapid Burster. Several authors (notably, Lewin et al.) have suggested that the bursts from GRO J1744-28 are type II bursts (which arise from the sudden release of gravitational potential energy). In this paper, we present another similarity between these sources. Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of GRO J1744-28 show that at least 10 out of 94 bursts are followed by quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with frequencies of ~0.4 Hz. The period of the oscillations decreases over their ~30-80 s lifetime, and they occur during a spectrally hard ``shoulder'' (or ``plateau'') that follows the burst. In one case, the QPOs show a modulation envelope that resembles simple beating between two narrow-band oscillations at ~0.325 and ~0.375 Hz. Using EXOSAT observations, Lubin et al. found QPOs with frequencies of 0.039-0.056 Hz following 10 out of 95 type II bursts from the Rapid Burster. As in GRO J1744-28, the period of these oscillations decreased over their ~100 s lifetime, and they occurred only during spectrally hard ``humps'' in the persistent emission. Even though the QPO frequencies differ by a factor of ~10, we believe that this is further evidence that a similar accretion disk instability is responsible for the type II bursts from these two sources.},

@article{Cui97,
	abstract = {We present observational evidence for ``propeller'' effects in two X-ray pulsars, GX 1+4 and GRO J1744-28. Both sources were monitored regularly by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) throughout a decay period in the X-ray brightness. Quite remarkably, strong X-ray pulsation became unmeasurable when total X-ray flux had dropped below a certain threshold. Such a phenomenon is a clear indication of the propeller effects that take place when pulsar magnetosphere grows beyond the co-rotation radius as a result of the decrease in mass accretion rate and the centrifugal force prevents accreting matter from reaching the magnetic poles. The entire process should simply reverse as the accretion rate increases. Indeed, steady X-ray pulsation was reestablished as the sources emerged from the nonpulsating faint state. These data allow us to directly derive the surface polar magnetic field strength for both pulsars: 3.1 × 1013 G for GX 1+4 and 2.4 × 1011 G for GRO J1744-28. The results are likely to be accurate to within a factor of 2, with the total uncertainty dominated by the uncertainty in estimating the distances to the sources. Possible mechanisms for the persistent emission observed in the faint state are discussed in light of the extreme magnetic properties of the sources.},

@article{Rappaport97,
	abstract = {GRO J1744-28 is the first known X-ray source to display bursts, periodic pulsations, and quasi-periodic oscillations. This source may thus provide crucial clues that will lead to an understanding of the differences in the nature of the X-ray variability from various accreting neutron stars. The orbital period is 11.8 days, and the measured mass function of 1.31 × 10-4 M&sun; is one of the smallest among all known binaries. If we assume that the donor star is a low-mass giant transferring matter through the inner Lagrange point, then we can show that its mass is lower than ~0.7 M&sun; and probably closer to 0.25 M&sun;. Higher mass, but unevolved, donor stars are shown to be implausible. We also demonstrate that the current He core mass of the donor star lies in the range of 0.20-0.25 M&sun;. Thus, this system is most likely in the final stages of losing its hydrogen-rich envelope, with only a small amount of mass remaining in the envelope. If this picture is correct, then GRO J1744-28 may well represent the closest observational link that we have between the low-mass X-ray binaries and recycled binary pulsars in wide orbits.  We have carried out a series of binary evolution calculations and explored, both systematically and via a novel Monte Carlo approach, the range of initial system parameters and input physics that can lead to the binary parameters of the present-day GRO J1744-28 system. The input parameters include both the initial total mass and the core mass of the donor star, the neutron-star mass, the strength of the magnetic braking, the mass-capture fraction, and the specifics of the core mass/radius relation for giants. Through these evolution calculations, we compute probability distributions for the current binary system parameters (i.e., the total mass, core mass, radius, luminosity, and K-band magnitude of the donor star, the neutron star mass, the orbital inclination angle, and the semimajor axis of the binary). Our calculations yield the following values for the GRO J1744-28 system parameters (with 95% confidence limits in parentheses): donor star mass: 0.24 M&sun; (0.2-0.7 M&sun;) He core mass of the donor star: 0.22 M&sun; (0.20-0.25 M&sun;) neutron-star mass: 1.7 M&sun; (1.39-1.96 M&sun;) orbital inclination angle: 18$\,^{\circ}$ (7$\,^{\circ}$-22$\,^{\circ}$) semimajor axis: 64 lt-s (60-67 lt-s) radius of the donor star: 6.2 R&sun; (6-9 R&sun;) luminosity of donor star: 23 L&sun; (15-49 L&sun;) and long-term mass transfer rate at the current epoch: 5 × 10-10 M&sun; yr-1 (2 × 10-10 to 5 × 10-9 M&sun; yr-1).  We deduce that the magnetic field of the underlying neutron star lies in the range of ~1.8 × 1011 G to ~7 × 1011 G, with a most probable value of 2.7 × 1011 G. This is evidently sufficiently strong to funnel the accretion flow onto the magnetic polar caps and suppress the thermonuclear flashes that would otherwise give rise to the type I X-ray bursts observed in most X-ray bursters. We present a simple paradigm for magnetic accreting neutron stars wherein X-ray pulsars, GRO J1744-28, the Rapid Burster, and the type I X-ray bursters may form a continuum of possible behaviors among accreting neutron stars, with the strength of the neutron-star magnetic field serving as the crucial parameter that determines the mode of X-ray variability from a given object.},

	abstract = {We report the detection with ROSAT of a transient X-ray source at R.A. 17h44m33.1s and decl. -28$\,^{\circ}$44'29" (J2000), which we identify with the transient bursting pulsar GRO J1744-28. We have made K-band observations of the X-ray source at ESO and the US Naval Observatory, Flagstaff Station. A K-band counterpart of this transient previously identified by us on an image taken 1996 February 8 by Blanco et al. is found to be detected during only two (of seven) short exposures of which this image is composed. We cannot definitely reject the reality of this variable object but feel that it is not possible to rule out an instrumental effect. The lack of a persistent K-band counterpart of GRO J1744-28 is consistent with the idea that the low-energy emission from this object is dominated by reprocessing of X-rays in an accretion disk.},

The system has been regularly monitored with the RXTE PCA since the peak of the first outburst in January 96 at which time the observed persistent and bursting count rates were ~25,000 ct/sec and ~150,000 ct/sec, with corresponding instrumental deadtimes of ~10% and > 50%. We present a model which allows the reconstruction of the true incident count rate in the presence of enormous deadtime and use the model to derive a history of the peak luminosities and fluences of the bursts as a function of time. During the peak of the January 1996 and January 1997 outbursts, when the persistent emission was > 1 Crab, we infer peak luminosities of ~100 times the Eddington luminosity, and a ratio of persistent emission to integrated burst emission of ~34.},

Between these two outbursts, the pulsar was detectable during each observation down to fluxes perhaps one thousandth of the persistent flux at the peak of the first outburst.

The pulsations are also present (at an enhanced amplitude) during the bursts, but the arrival times of the pulses during the burst are delayed with respect to those of the persistent emission. We present the results of a detailed study of the pulse delays using data obtained with the Burst and Transient Source Experiment on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. We find that the average delay, as measured during a 1.5 s interval at the peak of the burst, is independent of energy in the energy range ~25-75 keV and has a magnitude <Deltat>=74+/-13 ms. We also find that the phase delay measured near the peak of the bursts remained approximately constant throughout the first outburst of the source, although the peak flux of the bursts varied by a factor of ~3.3.},

When the accreted mass of the star exceeds some critical mass, its crust may break, resulting in conversion of the accreted matter into strange matter and release of energy. Subsequently, a fireball may form and expand relativistically outward. The expanding fireball may interact with the surrounding interstellar medium, causing its kinetic energy to be radiated in shock waves, producing a burst of x-ray radiation. The burst energy, duration, interval and spectrum derived from such a model are consistent with the observations of GRO J1744-28.},

It is suggested that two envelope crusts shield the two polar caps of an accreting strange stars owing to strong polar-cap magnetic fields. GRO J1744-28 might not have a unified crust, but two polar crusts. Bursts are the result of phase transition of polar crusts if one accreting crust is heavier than that the Coulomb force can support. It is shown that there should be phase-lags when bursting crust is expanded about one hundred meters. Many calculated properties of this model, such as the phase-lags, the bursting luminosity and the characteristic photon energy, are in agreement with observations.},

	abstract = {One year after its discovery, the Bursting Pulsar (GRO J1744-28) went into outburst again, displaying the hard X-ray bursts and pulsations that make this source unique. We report on BATSE observations of both the persistent and burst emission for this second outburst and draw comparisons with the first. The second outburst was smaller than the first in both duration and peak luminosity. The persistent flux, burst peak flux, and burst fluence were all reduced in amplitude by a factor of ~1.7. Despite these differences, the two outbursts were very similar with respect to the burst occurrence rate, the durations and spectra of bursts, the absence of spectral evolution during bursts, and the evolution of the ratio alpha of average persistent to burst luminosity. Although no spectral evolution was found within individual bursts, we find evidence for a small (20%) variation of the spectral temperature during the course of the second outburst.},

	abstract = {We report the ASCA results of the bursting X-ray pulsar GRO J1744-28, which was observed in 1996 February and 1997 March. The source flux in the 2-10 keV band was 2.0×10-8 ergs s-1 cm2 in 1996 and 5.0×10-9 ergs s-1 cm2 in 1997. We detected 12 and 17 type II bursts during the two observations, with mean bursting intervals of about 27 min and 37 min. Each burst is followed by an intensity dip with the depleted flux depending on the burst fluence. The energy spectra are approximated by an absorbed power law with additional structure around 6-7 keV. The constant absorption column, (5-6)×1022 cm-2, independent of the observation dates and emission phases (persistent, burst, and dip) is interpreted as an interstellar absorption. The source may be actually located near the Galactic center, at a distance of 8.5 kpc. The structure in the energy spectrum at 6-7 keV is most probably due to iron and may be reproduced by a disk line model with additional broadening mechanism.},

Triangulating each burst and statistically combining the triangulation annuli, we obtain a 3 sigma error ellipse whose area is 532 arcsec2. The accuracy of this statistical method has been independently verified with observations of the soft gamma repeater SGR 1900+14. The ellipse is fully contained within the 1' radius ASCA error circle of the soft X-ray counterpart and partially overlaps the 10'' radius ROSAT error circle of a source which may also be the soft X-ray counterpart. A variable source which has been proposed as a possible IR counterpart lies at the edge of the 3 sigma error ellipse, making it unlikely from a purely statistical point of view to be associated with the bursting pulsar.},

	abstract = {The hard X-ray bursts observed during both major outbursts of the Bursting Pulsar (GRO J1744-28) show pulsations near the neutron star spin frequency with an enhanced amplitude relative to that of the persistent emission. Consistent with previous work, we find that the pulsations within bursts lag behind their expected arrival times based upon the persistent pulsar ephemeris. For an ensemble of 1293 bursts recorded with the Burst and Transient Source Experiment, the average burst pulse time delay (DeltatFWHM) is 61.0+/-0.8 ms in the 25-50 keV energy range and 72+/-5 ms in the 50-100 keV band. The residual time delay (Deltatresid) from 10 to 240 s following the start of the burst is 18.1+/-0.7 ms (25-50 keV). A significant correlation of the average burst time delay with burst peak flux is found. Our results are consistent with the model of the pulse time lags presented by Miller.},

	abstract = {We present the results of the GRANAT/SIGMA hard X-/soft gamma-ray long-term monitoring of the Galactic center (GC) region concerning the source GRO J1744-28, discovered on 1995 December 2 by CGRO/BATSE. SIGMA observed the region containing the source in 14 opportunities between 1990 and 1997. In two of these observing sessions, corresponding to 1996 March and 1997 March, GRO J1744-28 was detected with a confidence level greater than 5 sigma in the 35-75 keV energy band without detection in the 75-150 keV energy band. For the other sessions, upper limits of the flux are indicated. The particular imaging capabilities of the SIGMA telescope allow us to identify, specifically, the source position in the very crowded GC region, giving us a mean flux of (73.1+/-5.5)×10-11 and (44.7+/-6.4)×10-11 ergs cm-2 s-1 in the 35-75 keV energy band, for the 1996 March and 1997 March observing sessions, respectively. Combining the 1997 March SIGMA and BATSE observations, we found evidence pointing to the type II nature of the source bursts for this period. For the same observing campaigns, spectra were obtained in the 35 to 150 keV energy band. The best fit corresponds to an optically thin thermal Bremsstrahlung with F50keV=3.6(+/-0.6)×10-4 photons cm-2 s-1 keV-1 and kTBremss=28+/-7 keV for the first campaign, and F50keV=2.3(+/-0.7)×10-4 photons cm-2 s-1 keV-1 and kTBremss=18+12-7 keV for the second. This kind of soft spectrum is typical of binary sources containing a neutron star as the compact object, in contrast to the harder spectra typical of systems containing a black hole candidate.},

	abstract = {Using VLT/ISAAC, we have detected two candidate counterparts to the bursting pulsar GRO J1744-28, one bright and one faint, both within the X-ray error circles found using XMM-Newton and Chandra. In determining the spectral types of the counterparts we applied three different extinction corrections; one for an all-sky value, one for a Galactic bulge value and one for a local value. We find that the local value, with an extinction law of alpha = 3.23 +/- 0.01 is the only correction that results in colours and magnitudes for both the bright and faint counterparts that are consistent with a small range of spectral types, and in the case of the bright counterpart are also consistent with the spectroscopic identification. Photometry of the fainter candidate then indicates that it is a K7/M0 V star at a distance of 3.75 +/- 1kpc. Such a star would require a very low inclination angle (i < 9$\,^{\circ}$) to satisfy the mass function constraints; however, this source cannot be excluded as the counterpart without follow-up spectroscopy to detect emission signatures of accretion. Photometry and spectroscopy of the bright candidate indicate that it is most likely a G/K III star. The spectrum does not show Brackett-gamma emission, a known indicator of accretion. The bright star's magnitudes are in agreement with the constraints placed on the probable counterpart by the calculations of Rappaport & Joss for an evolved star that has had its envelope stripped. The mass function indicates that the most likely counterpart has M < 0.3Msolar for an inclination of i >= 15$\,^{\circ}$ a stripped giant, or a main-sequence M3+V star would be consistent with this mass function constraint. In both cases mass transfer, if present, will be by wind accretion as the counterpart will not fill its Roche lobe given the observed orbital period. In this case, the derived magnetic field strength of 2.4 × 1011 G is sufficient to inhibit accretion of captured material by the propeller effect, hence the quiescent state of the system.},

	abstract = {We calculated the evolution of long-period white dwarf binaries, by accounting for thermally unstable accretion during mass transfer. Under certain conditions we found that, the accretion rates onto the white dwarf during dwarf nova outbursts can be sufficiently high to allow steady nuclear burning of the accreted matter and growth of the white dwarf mass. If the Chandrasekhar mass is reached, the white dwarf may collapse to be a neutron star, or explode as a type Ia supernova. This scenario appears to account well for the formation of the bursting pulsar GRO J1744-28, and probably type Ia supernovae with delay times considerably longer than 1 Gyr.},

@article{Burderi97,
	abstract = {The power spectra of X-ray pulsars often show the presence of a red-noise component. This noise is produced by aperiodic variability believed to be associated with instabilities that seem to occur in accretion flows onto compact objects. In this paper we discuss how, independently of the details of the physical processes that generate these instabilities, a careful analysis of the power spectra can furnish some constraints on the distance from the stellar surface at which the sudden energy release associated with the instabilities occurs. In particular, any aperiodic variability coming from the accretion flow funneled toward the magnetic poles should be modulated at the pulsar spin period (coupling). We show how, in the power spectra, this coupling results in a broadening at the base of the harmonics. To investigate this effect, we have adopted a mathematical description of the noise in order to produce simulated light curves and the resulting power spectra. A comparison of power spectra from simulations with real data allows the detection or exclusion of the broadening effect. As an application of this method we have compared simulated power spectra with one obtained from a Ginga observation of the X-ray pulsar SMC X-1. For this source the coupling effect is evident.},

	abstract = {The bursting pulsar GRO J1744-28 is a Galactic low-mass X-ray binary that distinguishes itself by displaying type-II X-ray bursts: brief, bright flashes of X-ray emission that likely arise from spasmodic accretion. Combined with its coherent 2.1 Hz X-ray pulsations and relatively high estimated magnetic field, it is a particularly interesting source to study the physics of accretion flows around neutron stars. Here we report on Chandra/High Energy Transmission Grating observations obtained near the peak of its bright 2014 accretion outburst. Spectral analysis suggests the presence of a broad iron emission line centered at E l ~= 6.7 keV. Fits with a disk reflection model yield an inclination angle of i ~= 52$\,^{\circ}$ and an inner disk radius of R in ~= 85 GM/c 2, which is much further out than typically found for neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. Assuming that the disk is truncated at the magnetospheric radius of the neutron star, we estimate a magnetic field strength of B ~= (2-6) × 1010 G. Furthermore, we identify an absorption feature near ~= 6.85 keV that could correspond to blue-shifted Fe XXV and point to a fast disk wind with an outflow velocity of v out ~= (7.5-8.2) × 103 km s-1 (sime 0.025c-0.027c). If the covering fraction and filling factor are large, this wind could be energetically important and perhaps account for the fact that the companion star lost significant mass while the magnetic field of the neutron star remained strong.},

Indeed, the A -I relation can be independently probed by this method, which shows that the observations are well represented by a relation of the form I A with = 1 + 0.1.

@article{Ghosh78,
	abstract = {A model for disk accretion by a rotating magnetic neutron star is proposed which includes a detailed description of matter flow in the transition region between the disk and the magnetosphere. It is shown that the disk plasma cannot be completely screened from the stellar magnetic field and that the resulting magnetic coupling between the star and the disk exerts a significant torque on the star. On the assumption that the distortion of the residual stellar field lines threading the disk is limited by reconnection, the total accretion torque on the star is calculated. The calculated torque gives period changes in agreement with those observed in the pulsating X-ray sources and provides a natural explanation of why a fast rotator like Her X-1 has a spin-up rate much below the conventional estimate for slow rotators. It is shown that for such fast rotators, fluctuations in the mass-accretion rate can produce fluctuations in the accretion torque about 100 times larger. For sufficiently fast rotators or, equivalently, for sufficiently low accretion rates, the star experiences a braking torque even while accretion continues and without any mass ejection from its vicinity.},

@article{Kluzniak07,
	abstract = {We compute the properties of a geometrically thin, steady accretion disk surrounding a central rotating, magnetized star. The magnetosphere is assumed to entrain the disk over a wide range of radii. The model is simplified in that we adopt two (alternate) ad hoc, but plausible, expressions for the azimuthal component of the magnetic field as a function of radial distance. We find a solution for the angular velocity profile tending to corotation close to the central star and smoothly matching a Keplerian curve at a radius where the viscous stress vanishes. The value of this ``transition'' radius is nearly the same for both of our adopted B-field models. We then solve analytically for the torques on the central star and for the disk luminosity due to gravity and magnetic torques. When expressed in a dimensionless form, the resulting quantities depend on one parameter alone, the ratio of the transition radius to the corotation radius. For rapid rotators, the accretion disk may be powered mostly by spin-down of the central star. These results are independent of the viscosity prescription in the disk. We also solve for the disk structure for the special case of an optically thick alpha disk. Our results are applicable to a range of astrophysical systems including accreting neutron stars, intermediate polar cataclysmic variables, and T Tauri systems.},

	abstract = {The torque exerted on a magnetized neutron star undergoing steady, axisymmetric disc accretion is re-evaluated. As in the widely adopted model of Ghosh and Lamb, the magnetospheric field is assumed to thread the disc both inside and outside the radius of corotation, yielding opposing contributions to the net torque from the forward- and backward-swept field lines. It is shown, however, that the particular pitch distribution postulated by Ghosh and Lamb is not consistent, since the resulting magnetic pressure would disrupt their disc beyond the corotation point. By taking the winding rate proportional to the poloidal rather than the toroidal component of the field, the author obtains a more realistic behaviour for the magnetic stresses generated by the rotational shear. He then discusses the results in the light of period-change measurements for several binary X-ray pulsars.},

Spin-down stresses are transmitted to the star by the field lines that penetrate the disk beyond the corotation radius Rc. As the dipole inclination angle chi increases, the vertical magnetic flux through the disk decreases, and the spin-down contribution to the torque weakens. For inclinations exceeding some limiting value chic in the range of approximately 54$\,^{\circ}$-67$\,^{\circ}$, the braking component is unable to offset the spin-up resulting from the accretion of matter, even when the inner radius of the Keplerian disk, R0, is located very close to Rc, so that the fastness parameter omega ≡ (R0/Rc)3/2 approaches unity. Thus, for large tilt angles, there can be no steady equilibrium state in which the net torque on the accreting star vanishes, unless some of the material is simultaneously expelled by centrifugal forces or accumulates within the disk.},

We point out that the value of xi in fact depends on the fraction of the star's magnetic flux threading the disk, which is poorly known from theory: in general, xi ~= 1.35 eta 4/7, where eta <= 1 denotes the threading coefficient. Application of the beat frequency model to binary X-ray pulsars showing quasi-periodic oscillations suggests strongly that eta ~ 1 for these objects: the stellar dipole field essentially fully threads the disk and xi ~= 1. When combined with improved accretion torque models characterized by critical fastness parameters near unity, the corrected values of xi ≡ R0/rA should allow more reliable determinations of the accreting star's dipole moment and mass-radius relationship.},

In the equilibrium state (for which there is no net torque on the star), the inner edge of the Keplerian disk R0 is located very close to the corotation radius Rc, for physically plausible assumptions about the dissipation time of the wound-up field component; the equilibrium value omega crit of the "fastness parameter" omega ≡ (R0/Rc)3/2 lies in the range 0.875--0.95. Empirical constraints requiring omega crit to be significantly less than unity are thus incompatible with the magnetically threaded disk model.},

	abstract = {We analyse the spectral and pulse properties of the 11 Hz transient accreting pulsar, IGR J17480-2446, in the globular cluster Terzan 5, considering all the available Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer, Swift and INTEGRAL observations performed during the outburst shown between 2010 October and November.  By measuring the pulse phase evolution we conclude that the neutron star (NS) spun up at an average rate of ? Hz s-1, compatible with the accretion of the Keplerian angular momentum of matter at the inner disc boundary. This confirms the trend previously observed by Papitto et al., who considered only the first few weeks of the outburst. Similar to other accreting pulsars, the stability of the pulse phases determined by using the second harmonic component is higher than that of the phases based on the fundamental frequency. Under the assumption that the second harmonic is a good tracer of the NS spin frequency, we successfully model its evolution in terms of a luminosity-dependent accretion torque. If the NS accretes the specific Keplerian angular momentum of the in-flowing matter, we estimate the inner disc radius to lie between 47 and 93 km when the luminosity attains its peak value. Smaller values are obtained if the interaction between the magnetic field lines and the plasma in the disc is considered.  The phase-averaged spectrum is described by thermal Comptonization of photons with energy of ≈1 keV. A hard to soft state transition is observed during the outburst rise. The Comptonized spectrum evolves from a Comptonizing cloud at an electron temperature of ≈20 keV towards an optically denser cloud at kTe≈ 3 keV. At the same time, the pulse amplitude decreases from 27 per cent to few per cent, as already noted by Papitto et al., and becomes strongly energy dependent. We discuss various possibilities to explain such a behaviour, proposing that at large accretion luminosities a significant fraction of the in-falling matter is not channelled towards the magnetic poles, but rather accretes more evenly on to the NS surface.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the spin and orbital properties of the newly discovered accreting pulsar IGR J17480-2446, located in the globular cluster Terzan 5. Considering the pulses detected by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer at a period of 90.539645(2) ms, we derive a solution for the 21.27454(8) hr binary system. The binary mass function is estimated to be 0.021275(5) M&sun;, indicating a companion star with a mass larger than 0.4 M&sun;. The X-ray pulsar spins up while accreting at a rate of between 1.2 and 1.7 × 10-12 Hz s-1, in agreement with the accretion of disc matter angular momentum given the observed luminosity. We also report the detection of pulsations at the spin period of the source during a Swift observation performed ~2 d before the beginning of the RXTE coverage. Assuming that the inner disc radius lies in between the neutron star radius and the corotation radius while the source shows pulsations, we estimate the magnetic field of the neutron star to be within ~ 2 × 108 G and ~ 2.4 × 1010 G. From this estimate, the value of the spin period and of the observed spin-up rate, we associate this source with the still poorly sampled population of slow, mildly recycled, accreting pulsars.},
